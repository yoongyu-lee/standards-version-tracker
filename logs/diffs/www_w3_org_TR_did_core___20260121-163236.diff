+Abstract
+Decentralized identifiers
+(DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
+enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A
+DID
+refers to any
+subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)
+as determined by the controller of the
+DID
+. In contrast to
+typical, federated identifiers,
+DIDs
+have been designed so that they may
+be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate
+authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the
+discovery of information related to a
+DID
+, the design enables the
+controller of a
+DID
+to prove control over it without requiring permission
+from any other party.
+DIDs
+are
+URIs
+that associate a
+DID
+subject
+with a
+DID document
+allowing trustable interactions
+associated with that subject.
+Each
+DID document
+can express cryptographic material,
+verification
+methods
+, or
+services
+, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a
+DID controller
+to prove control of the
+DID
+.
+Services
+enable
+trusted interactions associated with the
+DID subject
+. A
+DID
+might
+provide the means to return the
+DID subject
+itself, if the
+DID
+subject
+is an information resource such as a data model.
+This document specifies the DID syntax, a common data model, core properties,
+serialized representations, DID operations, and an explanation of the process
+of resolving DIDs to the resources that they represent.

+Introduction
+This section is non-normative.
+As individuals and organizations, many of us use globally unique identifiers in
+a wide variety of contexts. They serve as communications addresses (telephone
+numbers, email addresses, usernames on social media), ID numbers (for passports,
+drivers licenses, tax IDs, health insurance), and product identifiers (serial
+numbers, barcodes, RFIDs). URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) are used for
+resources on the Web and each web page you view in a browser has a globally
+unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
+The vast majority of these globally unique identifiers are not under our
+control. They are issued by external authorities that decide who or what they
+refer to and when they can be revoked. They are useful only in certain contexts
+and recognized only by certain bodies not of our choosing. They might
+disappear or cease to be valid with the failure of an organization. They might
+unnecessarily reveal personal information. In many cases, they can be
+fraudulently replicated and asserted by a malicious third-party, which is
+more commonly known as "identity theft".
+The Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) defined in this specification are a new
+type of globally unique identifier. They are designed to enable individuals and
+organizations to generate their own identifiers using systems they trust. These
+new identifiers enable entities to prove control over them by authenticating
+using cryptographic proofs such as digital signatures.
+Since the generation and assertion of Decentralized Identifiers is
+entity-controlled, each entity can have as many DIDs as necessary to maintain
+their desired separation of identities, personas, and interactions. The use of
+these identifiers can be scoped appropriately to different contexts. They
+support interactions with other people, institutions, or systems that require
+entities to identify themselves, or things they control, while providing control
+over how much personal or private data should be revealed, all without depending
+on a central authority to guarantee the continued existence of the identifier.
+These ideas are explored in the DID Use Cases document [
+DID-USE-CASES
+].
+This specification does not presuppose any particular technology or cryptography
+to underpin the generation, persistence, resolution, or interpretation of DIDs.
+For example, implementers can create Decentralized Identifiers based on
+identifiers registered in federated or centralized identity management systems.
+Indeed, almost all types of identifier systems can add support for DIDs. This
+creates an interoperability bridge between the worlds of centralized, federated,
+and decentralized identifiers. This also enables implementers to design specific
+types of DIDs to work with the computing infrastructure they trust, such as
+distributed ledgers, decentralized file systems, distributed databases, and
+peer-to-peer networks.
+This specification is for:
+Anyone that wants to understand the core architectural principles that
+are the foundation for Decentralized Identifiers;
+Software developers that want to produce and consume Decentralized Identifiers
+and their associated data formats;
+Systems integrators that want to understand how to use Decentralized
+Identifiers in their software and hardware systems;
+Specification authors that want to create new DID infrastructures, known as DID
+methods, that conform to the ecosystem described by this document.
+In addition to this specification, readers might find the
+Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers [
+DID-USE-CASES
+]
+document useful.
+1.1
+A Simple Example
+This section is non-normative.
+A
+DID
+is a simple text string consisting of three parts: 1) the
+did
+URI scheme identifier, 2) the identifier for the
+DID
+method
+, and 3) the DID method-specific identifier.

+A simple example of a decentralized identifier (DID)
+The example
+DID
+above resolves to a
+DID document
+. A
+DID
+document
+contains information associated with the
+DID
+, such as ways
+to cryptographically
+authenticate
+a
+DID controller
+.

+1.2
+Design Goals
+This section is non-normative.
+Decentralized Identifiers
+are a component of larger systems, such as the
+Verifiable Credentials ecosystem [
+VC-DATA-MODEL
+], which influenced the design
+goals for this specification. The design goals for Decentralized Identifiers
+are summarized here.
+Goal
+Description
+Decentralization
+Eliminate the requirement for centralized authorities or single point failure in
+identifier management, including the registration of globally unique
+identifiers, public verification keys,
+services
+, and other information.
+Control
+Give entities, both human and non-human, the power to directly control their
+digital identifiers without the need to rely on external authorities.
+Privacy
+Enable entities to control the privacy of their information, including minimal,
+selective, and progressive disclosure of attributes or other data.
+Security
+Enable sufficient security for requesting parties to depend on
+DID
+documents
+for their required level of assurance.
+Proof-based
+Enable
+DID controllers
+to provide cryptographic proof when interacting
+with other entities.
+Discoverability
+Make it possible for entities to discover
+DIDs
+for other entities, to
+learn more about or interact with those entities.
+Interoperability
+Use interoperable standards so
+DID
+infrastructure can make use of
+existing tools and software libraries designed for interoperability.
+Portability
+Be system- and network-independent and enable entities to use their digital
+identifiers with any system that supports
+DIDs
+and
+DID methods
+.
+Simplicity
+Favor a reduced set of simple features to make the technology easier to
+understand, implement, and deploy.
+Extensibility
+Where possible, enable extensibility provided it does not greatly hinder
+interoperability, portability, or simplicity.

+Six internally-labeled shapes appear in the diagram, with labeled arrows
+between them, as follows. In the center of the diagram is a rectangle labeled
+DID URL, containing small typewritten text "did:example:123/path/to/rsrc". At
+the center top of the diagram is a rectangle labeled, "DID", containing small
+typewritten text "did:example:123". At the top left of the diagram is an oval,
+labeled "DID Subject". At the bottom center of the diagram is a rectangle
+labeled, "DID document". At the bottom left is an oval, labeled, "DID
+Controller". On the center right of the diagram is a two-dimensional rendering
+of a cylinder, labeled, "Verifiable Data Registry".
+From the top of the "DID URL" rectangle, an arrow, labeled "contains", extends
+upwards, pointing to the "DID" rectangle. From the bottom of the "DID URL"
+rectangle, an arrow, labeled "refers, and
+dereferences

+to the "DID subject" oval. An arrow from the "DID controller" oval, labeled
+"controls", points right to the "DID document" rectangle. An arrow from the
+"DID" rectangle, labeled "recorded on", points downards to the right, to the
+"Verifiable Data Registry" cylinder. An arrow from the "DID document" rectangle,
+labeled "recorded on", points upwards to the right to the "Verifiable Data
+Registry" cylinder.
+DIDs and DID URLs
+A Decentralized Identifier, or
+DID
+, is a
+URI
+composed of three
+parts: the scheme
+did:
+, a method identifier, and a unique,
+method-specific identifier specified by the
+DID method
+.
+DIDs
+are
+resolvable to
+DID documents
+. A
+DID URL
+extends the syntax of a
+basic
+DID
+to incorporate other standard
+URI
+components such as
+path, query, and fragment in order to locate a particular
+resource
+—for example, a cryptographic public key inside a
+DID
+document
+, or a
+resource
+external to the
+DID document
+.
+These concepts are elaborated upon in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+and
+3.2
+DID URL Syntax
+.
+DID subjects
+The subject of a
+DID
+is, by definition, the entity identified by the
+DID
+. The
+DID subject
+might also be the
+DID controller
+.
+Anything can be the subject of a
+DID
+: person, group, organization,
+thing, or concept. This is further defined in
+5.1.1
+DID Subject
+.
+DID controllers
+The
+controller
+of a
+DID
+is the entity (person, organization, or
+autonomous software) that has the capability—as defined by a
+DID
+method
+—to make changes to a
+DID document
+. This capability is
+typically asserted by the control of a set of cryptographic keys used by
+software acting on behalf of the controller, though it might also be asserted
+via other mechanisms. Note that a
+DID
+might have more than one
+controller, and the
+DID subject
+can be the
+DID controller
+, or one
+of them. This concept is documented in
+5.1.2
+DID Controller
+.
+Verifiable data registries
+In order to be resolvable to
+DID documents
+,
+DIDs
+are typically
+recorded on an underlying system or network of some kind. Regardless of the
+specific technology used, any such system that supports recording
+DIDs
+and returning data necessary to produce
+DID documents
+is called a
+verifiable data registry
+. Examples include
+distributed ledgers
+,
+decentralized file systems, databases of any kind, peer-to-peer networks, and
+other forms of trusted data storage. This concept is further elaborated upon in
+8.
+Methods
+.
+DID documents
+DID documents
+contain information associated with a
+DID
+. They
+typically express
+verification methods
+, such as cryptographic public
+keys, and
+services
+relevant to interactions with the
+DID subject
+.
+The generic properties supported in a
+DID document
+are specified in
+5.
+Core Properties
+. A
+DID document
+can be serialized to a byte
+stream (see
+6.
+Representations
+). The properties present in
+a
+DID document
+can be updated according to the applicable operations
+outlined in
+8.
+Methods
+.
+DID methods
+DID methods
+are the mechanism by which a particular type of
+DID
+and its associated
+DID document
+are created, resolved, updated, and
+deactivated.
+DID methods
+are defined using separate DID method
+specifications as defined in
+8.
+Methods
+.
+DID resolvers and DID resolution
+A
+DID resolver
+is a system component that takes a
+DID
+as input and
+produces a conforming
+DID document
+as output. This process is called
+DID resolution
+. The steps for resolving a specific type of
+DID
+are
+defined by the relevant
+DID method
+specification. The process of
+DID
+resolution
+is elaborated upon in
+7.
+Resolution
+.
+DID URL dereferencers and DID URL dereferencing
+A
+DID URL dereferencer
+is a system component that takes a
+DID URL
+as input and produces a
+resource
+as output. This process is
+called
+DID URL dereferencing
+. The process of
+DID URL dereferencing
+is elaborated upon in
+7.2
+DID URL Dereferencing
+.
+1.4
+Conformance
+As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

+,
+MUST NOT

+RECOMMENDED
+,

+RFC2119
+] [
+RFC8174

+when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
+This document contains examples that contain JSON and JSON-LD content.
+Some of these examples contain characters that are invalid, such as inline
+comments (
+//
+) and the use of ellipsis (
+...
+) to denote
+information that adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to
+remove this content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON
+or JSON-LD.
+Some examples contain terms, both property names and values, that are not
+defined in this specification. These are indicated with a comment (
+//
+external (property name|value)
+). Such terms, when used in a
+DID
+document
+, are expected to be registered in the DID Specification Registries
+[
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+] with links to both a formal definition and a JSON-LD
+context.
+Interoperability of implementations for
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+is
+tested by evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+that conform to this specification. Interoperability
+for producers and consumers of
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+is provided
+by ensuring the
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+conform. Interoperability
+for
+DID method
+specifications is provided by the details in each
+DID
+method
+specification. It is understood that, in the same way that a web
+browser is not required to implement all known
+URI
+schemes, conformant
+software that works with
+DIDs
+is not required to implement all known
+DID methods
+. However, all implementations of a given
+DID method
+are expected to be interoperable for that method.

+2.
+Terminology
+This section is non-normative.
+This section defines the terms used in this specification and throughout
+decentralized identifier
+infrastructure. A link to these terms is
+included whenever they appear in this specification.
+amplification attack
+A class of attack where the attacker attempts to exhaust a target system's
+CPU, storage, network, or other resources by providing small, valid inputs into
+the system that result in damaging effects that can be exponentially more costly
+to process than the inputs themselves.
+authenticate
+Authentication is a process by which an entity can prove it has a specific
+attribute or controls a specific secret using one or more
+verification
+methods
+. With
+DIDs
+, a common example would be proving control of the
+cryptographic private key associated with a public key published in a
+DID
+document
+.
+cryptographic suite
+A specification defining the usage of specific cryptographic primitives in
+order to achieve a particular security goal. These documents are often used
+to specify
+verification methods
+, digital signature types,
+their identifiers, and other related properties.
+decentralized identifier
+(DID)
+A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized
+registration authority and is often generated and/or registered
+cryptographically. The generic format of a DID is defined in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. A specific
+DID scheme
+is defined in a
+DID
+method
+specification. Many—but not all—DID methods make use of
+distributed ledger technology
+(DLT) or some other form of decentralized
+network.
+decentralized identity management
+Identity
+management
+that is based on the use of
+decentralized identifiers
+.
+Decentralized identity management extends authority for identifier generation,
+registration, and assignment beyond traditional roots of trust such as
+X.500 directory services
+,
+the
+Domain Name System
+,
+and most national ID systems.
+DID controller
+An entity that has the capability to make changes to a
+DID document
+. A
+DID
+might have more than one DID controller. The DID controller(s)
+can be denoted by the optional
+controller
+property at the top level of the
+DID document
+. Note that a DID controller might be the
+DID
+subject
+.
+DID delegate
+An entity to whom a
+DID controller
+has granted permission to use a
+verification method
+associated with a
+DID
+via a
+DID
+document
+. For example, a parent who controls a child's
+DID document
+might permit the child to use their personal device in order to
+authenticate
+. In this case, the child is the
+DID delegate
+. The
+child's personal device would contain the private cryptographic material
+enabling the child to
+authenticate
+using the
+DID
+. However, the child
+might not be permitted to add other personal devices without the parent's
+permission.
+DID document
+A set of data describing the
+DID subject
+, including mechanisms, such as
+cryptographic public keys, that the
+DID subject
+or a
+DID delegate
+can use to
+authenticate
+itself and prove its association with the
+DID
+. A DID document might have one or more different
+representations
+as defined in
+6.
+Representations
+or in the
+W3C
+DID Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+].
+DID fragment
+The portion of a
+DID URL
+that follows the first hash sign character
+(
+#
+). DID fragment syntax is identical to URI fragment syntax.
+DID method
+A definition of how a specific
+DID method scheme
+is implemented. A DID method is
+defined by a DID method specification, which specifies the precise operations by
+which
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+are created, resolved, updated,
+and deactivated. See
+8.
+Methods
+.
+DID path
+The portion of a
+DID URL
+that begins with and includes the first forward
+slash (
+/
+) character and ends with either a question mark
+(
+?
+) character, a fragment hash sign (
+#
+) character,
+or the end of the
+DID URL
+. DID path syntax is identical to URI path syntax.
+See
+Path
+.
+DID query
+The portion of a
+DID URL
+that follows and includes the first question
+mark character (
+?
+). DID query syntax is identical to URI query
+syntax. See
+Query
+.
+DID resolution
+The process that takes as its input a
+DID
+and a set of resolution
+options and returns a
+DID document
+in a conforming
+representation
+plus additional metadata. This process relies on the "Read" operation of the
+applicable
+DID method
+. The inputs and outputs of this process are
+defined in
+7.1
+DID Resolution
+.
+DID resolver
+A
+DID resolver
+is a software and/or hardware component that performs the
+DID resolution
+function by taking a
+DID
+as input and producing a
+conforming
+DID document
+as output.
+DID scheme
+The formal syntax of a
+decentralized identifier
+. The generic DID scheme
+begins with the prefix
+did:
+as defined in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. Each
+DID method
+specification defines a specific
+DID method scheme that works with that specific
+DID method
+. In a specific DID
+method scheme, the DID method name follows the first colon and terminates with
+the second colon, e.g.,
+did:example:
+DID subject
+The entity identified by a
+DID
+and described by a
+DID document
+.
+Anything can be a DID subject: person, group, organization, physical thing,
+digital thing, logical thing, etc.
+DID URL
+A
+DID
+plus any additional syntactic component that conforms to the
+definition in
+3.2
+DID URL Syntax
+. This includes an optional
+DID
+path
+(with its leading
+/
+character), optional
+DID query
+(with its leading
+?
+character), and optional
+DID fragment
+(with its leading
+#
+character).
+DID URL dereferencing
+The process that takes as its input a
+DID URL
+and a set of input
+metadata, and returns a
+resource
+. This resource might be a
+DID
+document
+plus additional metadata, a secondary resource
+contained within the
+DID document
+, or a resource entirely
+external to the
+DID document
+. The process uses
+DID resolution
+to
+fetch a
+DID document
+indicated by the
+DID
+contained within the
+DID URL
+. The dereferencing process can then perform additional processing
+on the
+DID document
+to return the dereferenced resource indicated by the
+DID URL
+. The inputs and outputs of this process are defined in
+7.2
+DID URL Dereferencing
+.
+DID URL dereferencer
+A software and/or hardware system that performs the
+DID URL dereferencing
+function for a given
+DID URL
+or
+DID document
+.
+distributed ledger
+(DLT)
+A non-centralized system for recording events. These systems establish
+sufficient confidence for participants to rely upon the data recorded by others
+to make operational decisions. They typically use distributed databases where
+different nodes use a consensus protocol to confirm the ordering of
+cryptographically signed transactions. The linking of digitally signed
+transactions over time often makes the history of the ledger effectively
+immutable.
+public key description
+A data object contained inside a
+DID document
+that contains all the
+metadata necessary to use a public key or a verification key.
+resource
+As defined by [
+RFC3986
+]: "...the term 'resource' is used in a general sense
+for whatever might be identified by a URI." Similarly, any resource might serve
+as a
+DID subject
+identified by a
+DID
+.
+representation
+As defined for HTTP by [
+RFC7231
+]: "information that is intended to reflect a
+past, current, or desired state of a given resource, in a format that can be
+readily communicated via the protocol, and that consists of a set of
+representation metadata and a potentially unbounded stream of representation
+data." A

+service endpoint
+A network address, such as an HTTP URL, at which
+services
+operate on
+behalf of a
+DID subject
+.
+Uniform Resource Identifier
+(URI)
+The standard identifier format for all resources on the World Wide Web as
+defined by [
+RFC3986
+]. A
+DID
+is a type of URI scheme.
+verifiable credential
+A standard data model and representation format for cryptographically-verifiable
+digital credentials as defined by the
+W3C
+Verifiable Credentials specification
+[
+VC-DATA-MODEL
+].
+verifiable data registry
+A system that facilitates the creation, verification, updating, and/or
+deactivation of
+decentralized identifiers
+and
+DID documents
+. A
+verifiable data registry might also be used for other
+cryptographically-verifiable data structures such as
+verifiable
+credentials
+. For more information, see the
+W3C
+Verifiable Credentials
+specification [
+VC-DATA-MODEL
+].
+verifiable timestamp
+A verifiable timestamp enables a third-party to verify that a data object
+existed at a specific moment in time and that it has not been modified or
+corrupted since that moment in time. If the data integrity could reasonably have
+been modified or corrupted since that moment in time, the timestamp is not
+verifiable.
+verification method
+A set of parameters that can be used together with a process to independently
+verify a proof. For example, a cryptographic public key can be used as a
+verification method with respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it
+verifies that the signer possessed the associated cryptographic private key.
+"Verification" and "proof" in this definition are intended to apply broadly. For
+example, a cryptographic public key might be used during Diffie-Hellman key
+exchange to negotiate a shared symmetric key for encryption. This guarantees the
+integrity of the key agreement process. It is thus another type of verification
+method, even though descriptions of the process might not use the words
+"verification" or "proof."
+verification relationship
+An expression of the relationship between the
+DID subject
+and a
+verification method
+. An example of a verification relationship is
+5.3.1
+Authentication
+.
+Universally Unique Identifier
+(UUID)
+A type of globally unique identifier defined by [
+RFC4122
+]. UUIDs are similar
+to DIDs in that they do not require a centralized registration authority. UUIDs
+differ from DIDs in that they are not resolvable or
+cryptographically-verifiable.
+In addition to the terminology above, this specification also uses terminology
+from the [
+INFRA
+] specification to formally define the
+data model
+. When [
+INFRA
+] terminology is used, such as
+string
+,
+set
+, and
+map
+, it is linked directly to that specification.

+Identifier
+This section describes the formal syntax for
+DIDs
+and
+DID URLs
+.
+The term "generic" is used to differentiate the syntax defined here from syntax
+defined by
+specific
+DID methods
+in their respective
+specifications. The creation processes, and their timing, for
+DIDs
+and
+DID URLs
+are described in
+8.2
+Method Operations
+and
+B.2
+Creation of a DID
+.
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+The generic
+DID scheme
+is a
+URI
+scheme conformant with
+[
+RFC3986
+]. The ABNF definition can be found below, which uses the syntax in
+[
+RFC5234
+] and the corresponding definitions for
+ALPHA
+and
+DIGIT
+. All other rule names not defined in the ABNF below are
+defined in [
+RFC3986
+]. All
+DIDs
+MUST
+conform to the
+DID Syntax ABNF Rules.
+The DID Syntax ABNF Rules
+did                = "did:" method-name ":" method-specific-id
+method-name        = 1*method-char
+method-char        = %x61-7A / DIGIT
+method-specific-id = *( *idchar ":" ) 1*idchar
+idchar             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_" / pct-encoded
+pct-encoded        = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
+For requirements on
+DID methods
+relating to the
+DID
+syntax, see
+Section
+8.1
+Method Syntax
+.
+3.2
+DID URL Syntax
+A
+DID URL
+is a network location identifier for a specific
+resource
+. It can be used to retrieve things like representations
+of
+DID subjects
+,
+verification methods
+,
+services
+,
+specific parts of a
+DID document
+, or other resources.
+The following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [
+RFC5234
+]. It builds
+on the
+did
+scheme defined in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. The
+path-abempty
+,
+query
+, and
+fragment
+components are
+defined in [
+RFC3986
+]. All
+DID URLs
+MUST
+conform to the
+DID URL Syntax ABNF Rules.
+DID methods
+can further restrict these
+rules, as described in
+8.1
+Method Syntax
+.
+The DID URL Syntax ABNF Rules
+did-url = did path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
+Note
+: Semicolon character is reserved for future use
+Although the semicolon (
+;
+) character can be used according to the
+rules of the
+DID URL
+syntax, future versions of this specification may
+use it as a sub-delimiter for parameters as described in [
+MATRIX-URIS
+]. To
+avoid future conflicts, developers ought to refrain from using it.
+Path
+A
+DID path
+is identical to a generic
+URI
+path and conforms to the
+path-abempty
+ABNF rule in
+RFC 3986, section 3.3
+. As with
+URIs
+, path semantics can be specified by
+DID Methods
+, which in
+turn might enable
+DID controllers
+to further specialize those semantics.
+Example
+2
+did:example:123456/path
+Query
+A
+DID query
+is identical to a generic
+URI
+query and conforms to
+the
+query
+ABNF rule in
+RFC 3986, section 3.4
+. This syntax
+feature is elaborated upon in
+3.2.1
+DID Parameters
+.
+Example
+3
+did:example:123456?versionId=1
+Fragment
+DID fragment
+syntax and semantics are identical to a generic
+URI
+fragment and conforms to the
+fragment
+ABNF rule in
+RFC 3986, section 3.5
+.
+A
+DID fragment
+is used as a method-independent reference into a
+DID
+document
+or external
+resource
+. Some examples of DID fragment
+identifiers are shown below.
+Example
+4
+: A unique verification method in a DID Document
+did:example:123#public-key-0
+Example
+5
+: A unique service in a DID Document
+did:example:123#agent
+Example
+6
+: A resource external to a DID Document
+did:example:123?service=agent&relativeRef=/credentials#degree
+Note
+: Fragment semantics across representations
+In order to maximize interoperability, implementers are urged to ensure that
+DID fragments
+are interpreted in the same way across
+representations
+(see
+6.
+Representations
+). For example, while
+JSON Pointer [
+RFC6901
+] can be used in a
+DID fragment
+, it will not be
+interpreted in the same way across non-JSON
+representations
+.
+Additional semantics for fragment identifiers, which are compatible with and
+layered upon the semantics in this section, are described for JSON-LD
+representations in
+E.2
+application/did+ld+json
+. For information
+about how to dereference a
+DID fragment
+, see
+7.2
+DID URL Dereferencing
+.
+3.2.1
+DID Parameters
+The
+DID URL
+syntax supports a simple format for parameters based on the
+query
+component described in
+Query
+. Adding a DID
+parameter to a
+DID URL
+means that the parameter becomes part of the
+identifier for a
+resource
+.
+Example
+7
+: A DID URL with a 'versionTime' DID parameter
+did:example:123?versionTime=2021-05-10T17:00:00Z
+Example
+8
+: A DID URL with a 'service' and a 'relativeRef' DID parameter
+did:example:123?service=files&relativeRef=/resume.pdf
+Some DID parameters are completely independent of of any specific
+DID
+method
+and function the same way for all
+DIDs
+. Other DID parameters
+are not supported by all
+DID methods
+. Where optional parameters are
+supported, they are expected to operate uniformly across the
+DID methods
+that do support them. The following table provides common DID parameters that
+function the same way across all
+DID methods
+. Support for all
+DID Parameters
+is
+OPTIONAL
+.
+Note
+It is generally expected that DID URL dereferencer implementations will
+reference [
+DID-RESOLUTION
+] for additional implementation details. The scope
+of this specification only defines the contract of the most common
+query parameters.
+Parameter Name
+Description
+service
+Identifies a service from the
+DID document
+by service ID.
+If present, the associated value
+MUST
+be an
+ASCII string
+.
+relativeRef
+A relative
+URI
+reference according to
+RFC3986 Section 4.2
+that identifies a
+resource
+at a
+service endpoint
+, which is selected from a
+DID
+document
+by using the
+service
+parameter.
+If present, the associated value
+MUST
+be an
+ASCII string
+and
+MUST
+use percent-encoding for
+certain characters as specified in
+RFC3986
+Section 2.1
+.
+versionId
+Identifies a specific version of a
+DID document
+to be resolved (the
+version ID could be sequential, or a
+UUID
+, or method-specific).
+If present, the associated value
+MUST
+be an
+ASCII string
+.
+versionTime
+Identifies a certain version timestamp of a
+DID document
+to be resolved.
+That is, the
+DID document
+that was valid for a
+DID
+at a certain
+time. If present, the associated value
+MUST
+be an
+ASCII string
+which is a valid XML
+datetime value, as defined in section 3.3.7 of
+W3C
+XML Schema Definition Language
+(XSD) 1.1 Part 2: Datatypes
+[
+XMLSCHEMA11-2
+]. This datetime value
+MUST
+be
+normalized to UTC 00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision.
+For example:
+2020-12-20T19:17:47Z
+.
+hl
+A resource hash of the
+DID document
+to add integrity protection, as
+specified in [
+HASHLINK
+]. This parameter is non-normative.
+If present, the associated value
+MUST
+be an
+ASCII string
+.
+Implementers as well as
+DID method
+specification authors might use
+additional DID parameters that are not listed here. For maximum
+interoperability, it is
+RECOMMENDED
+that DID parameters use the DID
+Specification Registries mechanism [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+], to avoid collision
+with other uses of the same DID parameter with different semantics.
+DID parameters might be used if there is a clear use case where the parameter
+needs to be part of a
+URL
+that references a
+resource
+with more
+precision than using the
+DID
+alone. It is expected that DID parameters
+are
+not
+used if the same functionality can be expressed by passing
+input metadata to a
+DID resolver
+. Additional considerations for
+processing these parameters are discussed in [
+DID-RESOLUTION
+].
+Note
+: DID parameters and DID resolution
+The
+DID resolution
+and the
+DID URL dereferencing
+functions can
+be influenced by passing input metadata to a
+DID resolver
+that are
+not part of the
+DID URL
+(see
+7.1.1
+DID Resolution Options
+). This is comparable to
+HTTP, where certain parameters could either be included in an HTTP URL, or
+alternatively passed as HTTP headers during the dereferencing process. The
+important distinction is that DID parameters that are part of the
+DID
+URL
+should be used to specify
+what
+resource
+is being
+identified
+, whereas input metadata that is not part of the
+DID URL
+should be use to control
+how that
+resource
+is resolved or
+dereferenced
+.
+3.2.2
+Relative DID URLs
+A relative
+DID URL
+is any URL value in a
+DID document
+that does
+not start with
+did:<method-name>:<method-specific-id>
+. More
+specifically, it is any URL value that does not start with the ABNF defined in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. The URL is expected to reference
+a
+resource
+in the same
+DID document
+. Relative
+DID URLs
+MAY
+contain relative path components, query parameters, and fragment identifiers.
+When resolving a relative
+DID URL
+reference, the algorithm specified in
+RFC3986 Section 5: Reference Resolution
+MUST
+be used. The
+base URI
+value is the
+DID
+that is
+associated with the
+DID subject
+, see
+5.1.1
+DID Subject
+. The
+scheme
+is
+did
+. The
+authority
+is a
+combination of
+<method-name>:<method-specific-id>
+, and the
+path
+,
+query
+, and
+fragment
+values are those defined in
+Path
+,
+Query
+, and
+Fragment
+, respectively.
+Relative
+DID URLs
+are often used to reference
+verification methods
+and
+services
+in a
+DID Document
+without having to use absolute
+URLs.
+DID methods
+where storage size is a consideration might use
+relative URLs to reduce the storage size of
+DID documents
+.
+Example
+9
+: An example of a relative DID URL
+{
+"@context": [
+"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
+"https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
+]
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"verificationMethod": [{
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1",
+"type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
+// external (property value)
+"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
+}, ...],
+"authentication": [
+// a relative DID URL used to reference a verification method above
+"
+#key-1
+"
+]
+}
+In the example above, the relative
+DID URL
+value will be transformed to
+an absolute
+DID URL
+value of
+did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1
+.
+4.
+Data Model
+This specification defines a data model that can be used to express
+DID
+documents
+and DID document data structures, which can then be serialized
+into multiple concrete
+representations
+. This section provides a
+high-level description of the data model, descriptions of the ways different
+types of properties are expressed in the data model, and instructions for
+extending the data model.
+A
+DID document
+consists of a
+map
+of
+entries
+, where each entry consists of a
+key/value pair. The
+DID document
+data model contains at least two
+different classes of entries. The first class of entries is called properties,
+and is specified in section
+5.
+Core Properties
+. The second class
+is made up of
+representation-specific entries
+, and is specified in
+section
+6.
+Representations
+.
+Figure
+3
+The entries in a DID document.
+See also:
+narrative description
+.
+The diagram is titled, "Entries in the DID Document map". A dotted grey line
+runs horizontally through the center of the diagram. The space above the line
+is labeled "Properties", and the space below it, "Representation-specific
+entries". Six labeled rectangles appear in the diagram, three lying above the
+dotted grey line and three below it. A large green rectangle, labeled "DID
+Specification Registries", encloses the four leftmost rectangles (upper left,
+upper center, lower left, and lower center). The two leftmost rectangles
+(upper left and lower left) are outlined in blue and labeled in blue, as
+follows. The upper left rectangle is labeled "Core Properties", and contains
+text "id, alsoKnownAs, controller, authentication, verificationMethod, service,
+serviceEndpoint, ...". The lower left rectangle is labeled "Core
+Representation-specific Entries", and contains text "@context". The four
+rightmost rectangles (upper center, upper right, lower center, and lower right)
+are outlined in grey and labeled in black, as follows. The upper center
+rectangle is labeled, "Property Extensions", and contains text
+"ethereumAddress". The lower center rectangle is labeled,
+"Representation-specific Entry Extensions", and contains no other text. The
+upper right rectangle is labeled, "Unregistered Property Extensions", and
+contains text "foo". The lower right rectangle is labeled "Unregistered
+Representation-specific Entry Extensions", and contains text "%YAML, xmlns".
+All entry keys in the
+DID document
+data model are
+strings
+. All entry values are expressed using one
+of the abstract data types in the table below, and each
+representation
+specifies the concrete serialization format of each data type.
+Data Type
+Considerations
+map
+A finite ordered sequence of key/value pairs, with no key appearing twice as
+specified in [
+INFRA
+]. A map is sometimes referred to as an
+ordered map
+in [
+INFRA
+].
+list
+A finite ordered sequence of items as specified in [
+INFRA
+].
+set
+A finite ordered sequence of items that does not contain the same item twice
+as specified in [
+INFRA
+]. A set is sometimes referred to as an
+ordered set
+in [
+INFRA
+].
+datetime
+A date and time value that is capable of losslessly expressing all values
+expressible by a
+dateTime
+as specified in
+[
+XMLSCHEMA11-2
+].
+string
+A sequence of code units often used to represent human readable language
+as specified in [
+INFRA
+].
+integer
+A real number without a fractional component as specified in
+[
+XMLSCHEMA11-2
+]. To maximize
+interoperability, implementers are urged to heed the advice regarding
+integers in
+RFC8259, Section 6: Numbers
+.
+double
+A value that is often used to approximate arbitrary real numbers as specified
+in [
+XMLSCHEMA11-2
+]. To maximize
+interoperability, implementers are urged to heed the advice regarding
+doubles in
+RFC8259, Section 6: Numbers
+.
+boolean
+A value that is either true or false as defined in [
+INFRA
+].
+null
+A value that is used to indicate the lack of a value as defined in [
+INFRA
+].
+As a result of the
+data model
+being defined using
+terminology from [
+INFRA
+], property values which can contain more than one
+item, such as
+lists
+,
+maps
+and
+sets
+, are explicitly ordered. All list-like
+value structures in [
+INFRA
+] are ordered, whether or not that order is
+significant. For the purposes of this specification, unless otherwise stated,
+map
+and
+set
+ordering is not important and
+implementations are not expected to produce or consume deterministically ordered
+values.
+4.1
+Extensibility
+The data model supports two types of extensibility.
+For maximum interoperability, it is
+RECOMMENDED
+that extensions use the
+W3C
+DID Specification Registries mechanism [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+]. The use of
+this mechanism for new properties or other extensions is the only specified
+mechanism that ensures that two different
+representations
+will be able to
+work together.
+Representations
+MAY
+define other extensibility mechanisms, including ones
+that do not require the use of the DID Specification Registries. Such extension
+mechanisms
+SHOULD
+support lossless conversion into any other conformant
+representation
+. Extension mechanisms for a
+representation
+SHOULD
+define a mapping of all properties and
+representation
+syntax into the
+data model
+and its type system.
+Note
+: Unregistered extensions are less reliable
+It is always possible for two specific implementations to agree out-of-band to
+use a mutually understood extension or
+representation
+that is not
+recorded in the DID Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+];
+interoperability between such implementations and the larger ecosystem will be
+less reliable.
+5.
+Core Properties
+A
+DID
+is associated with a
+DID document
+.
+DID documents
+are expressed using the
+data model
+and can be serialized into a
+representation
+.

+5.1
+Identifiers
+This section describes the mechanisms by which
+DID documents
+include identifiers for
+DID subjects
+and
+DID controllers
+.
+5.1.1
+DID Subject
+The
+DID
+for a particular
+DID subject
+is expressed using the
+id
+property in the
+DID document
+.
+id
+The value of
+id
+MUST
+be a
+string
+that conforms to the rules in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+and
+MUST
+exist in the root
+map
+of the
+data
+model
+for the
+DID document
+.
+Example
+10
+{
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghijk"
+}
+The
+id
+property only denotes the
+DID
+of the
+DID subject
+when it is present in the
+topmost
+map
+of the
+DID document
+.
+Note
+: Intermediate representations
+DID method
+specifications can create intermediate representations of a
+DID document
+that do not contain the
+id
+property,
+such as when a
+DID resolver
+is performing
+DID resolution
+.
+However, the fully resolved
+DID document
+always contains a valid
+id
+property.
+5.1.2
+DID Controller
+A
+DID controller
+is an entity that is authorized to make changes to a
+DID document
+. The process of authorizing a
+DID controller
+is
+defined by the
+DID method
+.
+controller
+The
+controller
+property is
+OPTIONAL
+. If present, the value
+MUST
+be a
+string
+or a
+set
+of
+strings
+that conform to the rules in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. The corresponding
+DID document
+(s)
+SHOULD
+contain
+verification relationships
+that explicitly permit the use of
+certain
+verification methods
+for specific purposes.
+When a
+controller
+property is present in a
+DID
+document
+, its value expresses one or more
+DIDs
+. Any
+verification
+methods
+contained in the
+DID documents
+for those
+DIDs
+SHOULD
+be accepted as authoritative, such that proofs that satisfy those
+verification methods
+are to be considered equivalent to proofs provided
+by the
+DID subject
+.
+Example
+11
+: DID document with a controller property
+{
+"@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"controller": "did:example:bcehfew7h32f32h7af3",
+}
+Note
+: Authorization vs authentication
+Note that authorization provided by the value of
+controller
+is
+separate from authentication as described in
+5.3.1
+Authentication
+.
+This is particularly important for key recovery in the case of cryptographic key
+loss, where the
+DID subject
+no longer has access to their keys, or key
+compromise, where the
+DID controller
+'s trusted third parties need to
+override malicious activity by an attacker. See
+9.
+Security Considerations
+for information related to threat models
+and attack vectors.
+5.1.3
+Also Known As
+A
+DID subject
+can have multiple identifiers for different purposes, or
+at different times. The assertion that two or more
+DIDs
+(or other types
+of
+URI
+) refer to the same
+DID subject
+can be made using the
+alsoKnownAs
+property.
+alsoKnownAs
+The
+alsoKnownAs
+property is
+OPTIONAL
+. If present, the value
+MUST
+be a
+set
+where each item in the
+set is a
+URI
+conforming to [
+RFC3986
+].
+This relationship is a statement that the subject of this identifier is
+also identified by one or more other identifiers.
+Note
+: Equivalence and alsoKnownAs
+Applications might choose to consider two identifiers related by
+alsoKnownAs
+to be equivalent
+if
+the
+alsoKnownAs
+relationship is reciprocated in the reverse
+direction. It is best practice
+not
+to consider them equivalent in the
+absence of this inverse relationship. In other words, the presence of an
+alsoKnownAs
+assertion does not prove that this assertion
+is true. Therefore, it is strongly advised that a requesting party obtain
+independent verification of an
+alsoKnownAs
+assertion.
+Given that the
+DID subject
+might use different identifiers for different
+purposes, an expectation of strong equivalence between the two identifiers, or
+merging the information of the two corresponding
+DID documents
+, is not
+necessarily appropriate,
+even with
+a reciprocal relationship.
+5.2
+Verification Methods
+A
+DID document
+can express
+verification methods
+, such as
+cryptographic public keys, which can be used to
+authenticate
+or authorize
+interactions with the
+DID subject
+or associated parties. For example, a
+cryptographic public key can be used as a
+verification method
+with
+respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it verifies that the signer
+could use the associated cryptographic private key.
+Verification methods
+might take many parameters. An example of this is a set of five cryptographic
+keys from which any three are required to contribute to a cryptographic
+threshold signature.
+verificationMethod
+The
+verificationMethod
+property is
+OPTIONAL
+. If present, the value
+MUST
+be a
+set
+of
+verification
+methods
+, where each
+verification method
+is expressed using a
+map
+. The
+verification method
+map
+MUST
+include the
+id
+,
+type
+,
+controller
+, and specific verification material
+properties that are determined by the value of
+type
+and are defined
+in
+5.2.1
+Verification Material
+. A
+verification method
+MAY
+include additional properties.
+Verification methods
+SHOULD
+be registered
+in the DID Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+].
+id
+The value of the
+id
+property for a
+verification
+method
+MUST
+be a
+string
+that conforms to the
+rules in Section
+3.2
+DID URL Syntax
+.
+type
+The value of the
+type
+property
+MUST
+be a
+string
+that references exactly one
+verification
+method
+type. In order to maximize global interoperability, the
+verification method
+type
+SHOULD
+be registered in the DID Specification
+Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+].
+controller
+The value of the
+controller
+property
+MUST
+be a
+string
+that conforms to the rules in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+.
+Example
+12
+: Example verification method structure
+{
+"@context"
+: [
+"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"
+,
+"https://w3id.org/security/suites/jws-2020/v1"
+"https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
+]
+"id"
+:
+"did:example:123456789abcdefghi"
+,
+...
+"verificationMethod"
+: [{
+"id"
+: ...,
+"type"
+: ...,
+"controller"
+: ...,
+"publicKeyJwk"
+: ...
+}, {
+"id"
+: ...,
+"type"
+: ...,
+"controller"
+: ...,
+"publicKeyMultibase"
+: ...
+}]
+}
+Note
+: Verification method controller(s) and DID controller(s)
+The semantics of the
+controller
+property are the same when the
+subject of the relationship is the
+DID document
+as when the subject of
+the relationship is a
+verification method
+, such as a cryptographic public
+key. Since a key can't control itself, and the key controller cannot be inferred
+from the
+DID document
+, it is necessary to explicitly express the identity
+of the controller of the key. The difference is that the value of
+controller
+for a
+verification method
+is
+not
+necessarily a
+DID controller
+.
+DID controllers
+are expressed
+using the
+controller
+property at the highest level of the
+DID document
+(the topmost
+map
+in the
+data model
+); see
+5.1.2
+DID Controller
+.
+5.2.1
+Verification Material
+Verification material is any information that is used by a process that applies
+a
+verification method
+. The
+type
+of a
+verification
+method
+is expected to be used to determine its compatibility with such
+processes. Examples of verification material properties are
+publicKeyJwk
+or
+publicKeyMultibase
+. A
+cryptographic suite
+specification is responsible for specifying the
+verification method
+type
+and its associated verification
+material. For example, see
+JSON
+Web Signature 2020
+and
+Ed25519 Signature 2020
+.
+For all registered
+verification method
+types and associated verification
+material available for
+DIDs
+, please see the DID Specification Registries
+[
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+].
+To increase the likelihood of interoperable implementations, this specification
+limits the number of formats for expressing verification material in a
+DID
+document
+. The fewer formats that implementers have to
+implement, the more likely it will be that they will support all of them. This
+approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between ease of implementation
+and supporting formats that have historically had broad deployment.
+Two supported verification material properties are listed below:
+publicKeyJwk
+The
+publicKeyJwk
+property is
+OPTIONAL
+. If present, the value
+MUST
+be a
+map
+representing a JSON Web Key that
+conforms to [
+RFC7517
+]. The
+map
+MUST NOT
+contain "d", or any other members of the private information class as described
+in
+Registration
+Template
+. It is
+RECOMMENDED
+that verification methods that use JWKs
+[
+RFC7517
+] to represent their public keys use the value of
+kid
+as
+their
+fragment identifier
+. It is
+RECOMMENDED
+that JWK
+kid
+values are set to the public key fingerprint [
+RFC7638
+]. See
+the first key in
+Example
+13
+for
+an example of a public key with a compound key identifier.
+publicKeyMultibase
+The
+publicKeyMultibase
+property is
+OPTIONAL
+. This feature is
+non-normative. If present, the value
+MUST
+be a
+string
+representation of a [
+MULTIBASE
+] encoded
+public key.
+Note that the [
+MULTIBASE
+] specification is not yet a standard and is
+subject to change. There might be some use cases for this data format
+where
+public
+KeyMultibase
+is defined, to allow for
+expression of public keys, but
+private
+KeyMultibase
+is not defined, to protect against accidental leakage of secret keys.
+A
+verification method
+MUST NOT
+contain multiple verification material
+properties for the same material. For example, expressing key material in a
+verification method
+using both
+publicKeyJwk
+and
+publicKeyMultibase
+at the same time is prohibited.
+An example of a
+DID document
+containing
+verification methods
+using
+both properties above is shown below.
+Example
+13
+: Verification methods using publicKeyJwk and publicKeyMultibase

+}
+5.2.2
+Referring to Verification Methods
+Verification methods
+can be embedded in or referenced from properties
+associated with various
+verification relationships
+as described in
+5.3
+Verification Relationships
+. Referencing
+verification methods
+allows them to be used by more than one
+verification relationship
+.
+If the value of a
+verification method
+property is a
+map
+, the
+verification method
+has been
+embedded and its properties can be accessed directly. However, if the value is a
+URL
+string
+, the
+verification method
+has
+been included by reference and its properties will need to be retrieved from
+elsewhere in the
+DID document
+or from another
+DID document
+. This
+is done by dereferencing the URL and searching the resulting
+resource
+for a
+verification method
+map
+with an
+id
+property whose value matches the URL.
+Example
+14
+: Embedding and referencing verification methods
+{
+...
+"authentication": [
+// this key is referenced and might be used by
+// more than one verification relationship
+"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
+// this key is embedded and may *only* be used for authentication
+{
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
+"type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
+// external (property value)
+"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
+}
+],
+...
+}
+5.3
+Verification Relationships
+A
+verification relationship
+expresses the relationship between the
+DID
+subject
+and a
+verification method
+.
+Different
+verification relationships
+enable the associated
+verification methods
+to be used for different purposes. It is up to a
+verifier
+to ascertain the validity of a verification attempt by
+checking that the
+verification method
+used is contained in the
+appropriate
+verification relationship
+property of the
+DID Document
+.
+The
+verification relationship
+between the
+DID subject
+and the
+verification method
+is explicit in the
+DID document
+.
+Verification methods
+that are not associated with a particular
+verification relationship
+cannot be used for that
+verification
+relationship
+. For example, a
+verification method
+in the value of
+the
+authentication
+property cannot be used to engage in
+key agreement protocols with the
+DID subject
+—the value of the
+keyAgreement
+property needs to be used for that.
+The
+DID document
+does not express revoked keys using a
+verification
+relationship
+. If a referenced verification method is not in the latest
+DID Document
+used to dereference it, then that verification method is
+considered invalid or revoked. Each
+DID method
+specification is expected
+to detail how revocation is performed and tracked.
+The following sections define several useful
+verification relationships
+.
+A
+DID document
+MAY
+include any of these, or other properties, to
+express a specific
+verification relationship
+. In order to maximize global
+interoperability, any such properties used
+SHOULD
+be registered in the DID
+Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+].
+5.3.1
+Authentication
+The
+authentication
+verification relationship
+is used to
+specify how the
+DID subject
+is expected to be
+authenticated
+, for
+purposes such as logging into a website or engaging in any sort of
+challenge-response protocol.
+authentication
+The
+authentication
+property is
+OPTIONAL
+. If present, the associated
+value
+MUST
+be a
+set
+of one or more
+verification methods
+. Each
+verification method
+MAY
+be embedded or
+referenced.
+Example
+15
+: Authentication property
+containing three verification methods
+{
+"@context": [
+"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
+"https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
+],
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+...
+"authentication": [
+// this method can be used to authenticate as did:...fghi
+"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
+// this method is *only* approved for authentication, it may not
+// be used for any other proof purpose, so its full description is
+// embedded here rather than using only a reference
+{
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
+"type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
+"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
+}
+],
+...
+}
+If authentication is established, it is up to the
+DID method
+or other
+application to decide what to do with that information. A particular
+DID
+method
+could decide that authenticating as a
+DID controller
+is
+sufficient to, for example, update or delete the
+DID document
+. Another
+DID method
+could require different keys, or a different
+verification
+method
+entirely, to be presented in order to update or delete the
+DID
+document
+than that used to
+authenticate
+. In other words, what is done
+after
+the authentication check is out of scope for the
+data model
+;
+DID methods
+and applications are
+expected to define this themselves.
+This is useful to any
+authentication verifier
+that needs to check to
+see if an entity that is attempting to
+authenticate
+is, in fact,
+presenting a valid proof of authentication. When a
+verifier
+receives
+some data (in some protocol-specific format) that contains a proof that was made
+for the purpose of "authentication", and that says that an entity is identified
+by the
+DID
+, then that
+verifier
+checks to ensure that the proof
+can be verified using a
+verification method
+(e.g., public key) listed
+under
+authentication
+in the
+DID Document
+.
+Note that the
+verification method
+indicated by the
+authentication
+property of a
+DID document
+can only be
+used to
+authenticate
+the
+DID subject
+. To
+authenticate
+a
+different
+DID controller
+, the entity associated with the value of
+controller
+, as defined in
+5.1.2
+DID Controller
+, needs to
+authenticate
+with its
+own
+DID document
+and associated
+authentication
+verification relationship
+.
+5.3.2
+Assertion
+The
+assertionMethod
+verification relationship
+is used to
+specify how the
+DID subject
+is expected to express claims, such as for
+the purposes of issuing a Verifiable Credential [
+VC-DATA-MODEL
+].
+assertionMethod
+The
+assertionMethod
+property is
+OPTIONAL
+. If present, the
+associated value
+MUST
+be a
+set
+of
+one or more
+verification methods
+. Each
+verification method
+MAY
+be
+embedded or referenced.
+This property is useful, for example, during the processing of a
+verifiable
+credential
+by a verifier. During verification, a verifier checks to see if a
+verifiable credential
+contains a proof created by the
+DID subject
+by checking that the
+verification method
+used to assert the proof is
+associated with the
+assertionMethod
+property in the
+corresponding
+DID document
+.
+Example
+16
+: Assertion method property
+containing two verification methods
+{
+"@context": [
+"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
+"https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
+],
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+...
+"assertionMethod": [
+// this method can be used to assert statements as did:...fghi
+"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
+// this method is *only* approved for assertion of statements, it is not
+// used for any other verification relationship, so its full description is
+// embedded here rather than using a reference
+{
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
+"type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
+// external (property value)
+"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
+}
+],
+...
+}
+5.3.3
+Key Agreement
+The
+keyAgreement
+verification relationship
+is used to
+specify how an entity can generate encryption material in order to transmit
+confidential information intended for the
+DID subject
+, such as for
+the purposes of establishing a secure communication channel with the recipient.
+keyAgreement
+The
+keyAgreement
+property is
+OPTIONAL
+. If present, the associated
+value
+MUST
+be a
+set
+of one or more
+verification methods
+. Each
+verification method
+MAY
+be embedded or
+referenced.
+An example of when this property is useful is when encrypting a message intended
+for the
+DID subject
+. In this case, the counterparty uses the
+cryptographic public key information in the
+verification method
+to wrap a
+decryption key for the recipient.
+Example
+17
+: Key agreement property
+containing two verification methods
+{
+"@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+...
+"keyAgreement": [
+// this method can be used to perform key agreement as did:...fghi
+"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
+// this method is *only* approved for key agreement usage, it will not
+// be used for any other verification relationship, so its full description is
+// embedded here rather than using only a reference
+{
+"id": "did:example:123#zC9ByQ8aJs8vrNXyDhPHHNNMSHPcaSgNpjjsBYpMMjsTdS",

+"controller": "did:example:123",
+"publicKeyMultibase": "z9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
+}
+],
+...
+}
+5.3.4
+Capability Invocation
+The
+capabilityInvocation
+verification relationship
+is used
+to specify a
+verification method
+that might be used by the
+DID
+subject
+to invoke a cryptographic capability, such as the authorization to
+update the
+DID Document
+.
+capabilityInvocation
+The
+capabilityInvocation
+property is
+OPTIONAL
+. If present, the
+associated value
+MUST
+be a
+set
+of
+one or more
+verification methods
+. Each
+verification method
+MAY
+be
+embedded or referenced.
+An example of when this property is useful is when a
+DID subject
+needs to
+access a protected HTTP API that requires authorization in order to use it. In
+order to authorize when using the HTTP API, the
+DID subject
+uses a capability that is associated with a particular URL that is
+exposed via the HTTP API. The invocation of the capability could be
+expressed in a number of ways, e.g., as a digitally signed
+message that is placed into the HTTP Headers.
+The server providing the HTTP API is the
+verifier
+of the capability and
+it would need to verify that the
+verification method
+referred to by the
+invoked capability exists in the
+capabilityInvocation
+property of the
+DID document
+. The verifier would also check to make sure
+that the action being performed is valid and the capability is appropriate for
+the resource being accessed. If the verification is successful, the server has
+cryptographically determined that the invoker is authorized to access the
+protected resource.
+Example
+18
+: Capability invocation property
+containing two verification methods
+{
+"@context": [
+"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
+"https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
+],

+...
+"capabilityInvocation": [
+// this method can be used to invoke capabilities as did:...fghi
+"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
+// this method is *only* approved for capability invocation usage, it will not
+// be used for any other verification relationship, so its full description is
+// embedded here rather than using only a reference

+}
+],
+...
+}
+5.3.5
+Capability Delegation
+The
+capabilityDelegation
+verification relationship
+is used
+to specify a mechanism that might be used by the
+DID subject
+to delegate
+a cryptographic capability to another party, such as delegating the authority
+to access a specific HTTP API to a subordinate.
+capabilityDelegation
+The
+capabilityDelegation
+property is
+OPTIONAL
+. If present, the
+associated value
+MUST
+be a
+set
+of
+one or more
+verification methods
+. Each
+verification method
+MAY
+be
+embedded or referenced.
+An example of when this property is useful is when a
+DID controller
+chooses to delegate their capability to access a protected HTTP API to a party
+other than themselves. In order to delegate the capability, the
+DID
+subject
+would use a
+verification method
+associated with the
+capabilityDelegation
+verification relationship
+to
+cryptographically sign the capability over to another
+DID subject
+. The
+delegate would then use the capability in a manner that is similar to the
+example described in
+5.3.4
+Capability Invocation
+.
+Example
+19
+: Capability Delegation property
+containing two verification methods
+{
+"@context": [

+// this method can be used to perform capability delegation as did:...fghi
+"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
+// this method is *only* approved for granting capabilities; it will not
+// be used for any other verification relationship, so its full description is
+// embedded here rather than using only a reference
+{
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",

+}
+],
+...
+}
+5.4
+Services
+Services
+are used in
+DID documents
+to express ways of
+communicating with the
+DID subject
+or associated entities. A
+service
+can be any type of service the
+DID subject
+wants to
+advertise, including
+decentralized identity management
+services for
+further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction.
+Due to privacy concerns, revealing public information through
+services
+,
+such as social media accounts, personal websites, and email addresses, is
+discouraged. Further exploration of privacy concerns can be found in
+10.1
+Keep Personal Data Private
+and
+10.6
+Service Privacy
+. The
+information associated with
+services
+is often service specific. For
+example, the information associated with an encrypted messaging service can
+express how to initiate the encrypted link before messaging begins.
+Services
+are expressed using the
+service
+property,
+which is described below:
+service
+The
+service
+property is
+OPTIONAL
+. If present, the associated value
+MUST
+be a
+set
+of
+services
+,
+where each service is described by a
+map
+.
+Each
+service
+map
+MUST
+contain
+id
+,
+type
+, and
+serviceEndpoint
+properties. Each service extension
+MAY
+include additional properties and
+MAY
+further restrict the properties associated
+with the extension.
+id
+The value of the
+id
+property
+MUST
+be a
+URI
+conforming to
+[
+RFC3986
+]. A
+conforming producer
+MUST NOT
+produce
+multiple
+service
+entries with the same
+id
+.
+A
+conforming consumer
+MUST
+produce an error if it detects
+multiple
+service
+entries with the same
+id
+.
+type
+The value of the
+type
+property
+MUST
+be a
+string
+or a
+set
+of
+strings
+. In order to maximize interoperability,
+the
+service
+type and its associated properties
+SHOULD
+be
+registered in the DID Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+].
+serviceEndpoint
+The value of the
+serviceEndpoint
+property
+MUST
+be a
+string
+, a
+map
+, or
+a
+set
+composed of one or more
+strings
+and/or
+maps
+. All
+string
+values
+MUST
+be valid
+URIs
+conforming to [
+RFC3986
+] and normalized
+according to the
+Normalization and Comparison
+rules in RFC3986
+and to any normalization rules in its applicable
+URI

+Representations
+A concrete serialization of a
+DID document
+in this specification is
+called a
+representation
+. A
+representation
+is created by
+serializing the
+data model
+through a process called
+production
+. A
+representation
+is transformed into the
+data model
+through a process called
+consumption
+. The
+production
+and
+consumption
+processes enable the conversion of information from one
+representation
+to
+another. This specification defines
+representations
+for JSON and JSON-LD,
+and developers can use any other
+representation
+, such as XML or
+YAML, that is capable of expressing the
+data model
+.
+The following sections define the general rules for
+production
+and
+consumption
+, as well as the JSON and JSON-LD
+representations
+.
+6.1
+Production and Consumption
+In addition to the
+representations
+defined in this specification,
+implementers can use other
+representations
+, providing each such
+representation
+is properly specified (including rules for
+interoperable handling of properties not listed in the DID Specification
+Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+]). See
+4.1
+Extensibility
+for more information.
+The requirements for all
+representations
+are as follows:
+A
+representation
+MUST
+define deterministic production and consumption
+rules for all data types specified in
+4.
+Data Model
+.
+A
+representation
+MUST
+be uniquely associated with an IANA-registered
+Media Type.
+A
+representation
+MUST
+define fragment processing rules for its Media
+Type that are conformant with the fragment processing rules defined in
+Fragment
+.
+A
+representation
+SHOULD
+use the lexical representation of
+data model
+data types. For example, JSON and JSON-LD use
+the XML Schema
+dateTime
+lexical serialization to represent
+datetimes
+. A
+representation
+MAY
+choose to serialize the
+data model
+data types using a different lexical
+serializations as long as the
+consumption
+process back into the
+data model
+is lossless. For example, some CBOR-based
+representations
+express
+datetime
+values using integers to
+represent the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.
+A
+representation
+MAY
+define
+representation-specific entries
+that
+are stored in a
+representation-specific entries
+map
+for use during the
+production
+and
+consumption
+process. These
+entries are used when consuming or producing to aid in ensuring lossless
+conversion.
+In order to maximize interoperability,
+representation
+specification
+authors
+SHOULD
+register their
+representation
+in the DID Specification
+Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+].
+The requirements for all
+conforming producers
+are as follows:
+A
+conforming producer
+MUST
+take a
+DID document
+data model
+and a
+representation-specific entries
+map
+as input into the
+production
+process.
+The
+conforming producer
+MAY
+accept additional options as input
+into the
+production
+process.
+A
+conforming producer
+MUST
+serialize all entries in the
+DID
+document
+data model
+, and the
+representation-specific entries
+map
+,
+that do not
+have explicit processing rules for the
+representation
+being produced
+using only the
+representation
+'s data type processing rules and
+return the serialization after the
+production
+process completes.
+A
+conforming producer
+MUST
+return the Media Type
+string
+associated with the
+representation
+after the
+production
+process completes.
+A conforming producer
+MUST NOT
+produce non-conforming
+DIDs
+or
+DID
+documents
+.
+The requirements for all
+conforming consumers
+are as follows:
+A
+conforming consumer
+MUST
+take a
+representation
+and
+Media Type
+string
+as input into
+the
+consumption
+process. A
+conforming consumer
+MAY
+accept
+additional options as input into the
+consumption
+process.
+A
+conforming consumer
+MUST
+determine the
+representation
+of a
+DID document
+using the Media Type input
+string
+.
+A
+conforming consumer
+MUST
+detect any
+representation-specific
+entry
+across all known
+representations
+and place the entry into a
+representation-specific entries
+map
+which is returned after the
+consumption
+process completes. A list of
+all known
+representation-specific entries
+is available in the
+DID Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+].
+A
+conforming consumer
+MUST
+add all
+non-representation-specific
+entries
+that do not have explicit processing rules for the
+representation
+being
+consumed to the
+DID document
+data model
+using
+only the
+representation
+'s data type processing rules and return the
+DID document
+data model after the
+consumption
+process completes.
+A conforming consumer
+MUST
+produce errors when consuming non-conforming
+DIDs
+or
+DID documents
+.

+Note
+: Conversion between representations
+An implementation is expected to convert between
+representations
+by using
+the
+consumption
+rules on the source representation resulting in the
+data model
+and then using the
+production
+rules
+to serialize
+data model
+to the target representation,
+or any other mechanism that results in the same target representation.
+6.2
+JSON
+This section defines the
+production
+and
+consumption
+rules
+for the JSON
+representation
+.
+6.2.1
+Production
+The
+DID document
+, DID document data structures, and
+representation-specific entries
+map
+MUST
+be serialized to the JSON
+representation
+according to the following
+production
+rules:
+Data Type
+JSON Representation Type
+map
+A
+JSON Object
+, where each entry is
+serialized as a member of the JSON Object with the entry key as a
+JSON String
+member name and the entry value
+according to its type, as defined in this table.
+list
+A
+JSON Array
+, where each element of the
+list is serialized, in order, as a value of the array according to its type, as
+defined in this table.
+set
+A
+JSON Array
+, where each element of the set
+is added, in order, as a value of the array according to its type, as defined in
+this table.
+datetime
+A
+JSON String
+serialized as an
+XML Datetime
+normalized to
+UTC 00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision. For example:
+2020-12-20T19:17:47Z
+.
+string
+A
+JSON String
+.
+integer
+A
+JSON Number
+without a decimal or
+fractional component.
+double
+A
+JSON Number
+with a decimal and
+fractional component.
+boolean
+A
+JSON Boolean
+.
+null
+A
+JSON null literal
+.
+All implementers creating
+conforming producers
+that produce JSON
+representations
+are advised to ensure that their algorithms are aligned
+with the
+JSON
+serialization rules
+in the [
+INFRA
+] specification and the
+precision advisements regarding Numbers
+in the
+JSON [
+RFC8259
+] specification.
+All entries of a
+DID document
+MUST
+be included in the root
+JSON Object
+. Entries
+MAY
+contain additional
+data substructures subject to the value representation rules in the list above.
+When serializing a
+DID document
+, a
+conforming producer
+MUST
+specify a media type of
+application/did+json
+to downstream
+applications such as described in
+7.1.2
+DID Resolution Metadata
+.
+Example
+21
+: Example DID document in JSON representation
+{
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",

+"publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
+}]
+}
+6.2.2
+Consumption
+The
+DID document
+and DID document data structures JSON
+representation
+MUST
+be deserialized into the
+data
+model
+according to the following
+consumption
+rules:
+JSON Representation Type
+Data Type
+JSON Object
+A
+map
+, where each member of the JSON
+Object is added as an entry to the map. Each entry key is set as the
+JSON Object member name. Each entry value is set by converting the JSON Object
+member value according to the JSON representation type as defined in this table.
+Since order is not specified by JSON Objects, no insertion order is guaranteed.
+JSON Array
+where the
+data model
+entry value is a
+list
+or unknown
+A
+list
+, where each value of the JSON Array is
+added to the list in order, converted based on the JSON representation type of
+the array value, as defined in this table.
+JSON Array
+where the
+data model
+entry value is a
+set
+A
+set
+, where each value of
+the JSON Array is added to the set in order, converted based on the JSON
+representation type of the array value, as defined in this table.
+JSON String
+where
+data model
+entry value is a
+datetime
+A
+datetime
+.
+JSON String
+, where the
+data model
+entry value type is
+string
+or
+unknown
+A
+string
+.
+JSON Number
+without a decimal or
+fractional component
+An
+integer
+.
+JSON Number
+with a decimal and fractional
+component, or when entry value is a
+double
+regardless of inclusion of
+fractional component
+A
+double
+.
+JSON Boolean
+A
+boolean
+.
+JSON null literal
+A
+null
+value.
+All implementers creating
+conforming consumers
+that produce JSON
+representations
+are advised to ensure that their algorithms are aligned
+with the
+JSON
+conversion rules
+in the [
+INFRA
+] specification and the
+precision advisements regarding Numbers
+in the
+JSON [
+RFC8259
+] specification.
+If media type information is available to a
+conforming consumer
+and the
+media type value is
+application/did+json
+, then the data structure
+being consumed is a
+DID document
+, and the root element
+MUST
+be a
+JSON Object
+where all members of the object
+are entries of the
+DID document
+. A
+conforming consumer
+for a JSON
+representation
+that is consuming a
+DID document
+with a root
+element that is not a
+JSON Object
+MUST
+report an error.
+6.3
+JSON-LD
+JSON-LD [
+JSON-LD11
+] is a JSON-based format used to serialize
+Linked Data
+. This
+section defines the
+production
+and
+consumption
+rules for the
+JSON-LD
+representation
+.
+The JSON-LD
+representation
+defines the following
+representation-specific entries
+:
+@context
+The
+JSON-LD Context
+is either a
+string
+or a
+list
+containing any combination of
+strings
+and/or
+ordered
+maps
+.
+6.3.1
+Production
+The
+DID document
+, DID document data structures, and
+representation-specific entries
+map
+MUST
+be serialized to the JSON-LD
+representation
+according to the JSON
+representation
+production
+rules as defined in
+6.2
+JSON
+.
+In addition to using the JSON
+representation
+production
+rules,
+JSON-LD production
+MUST
+include the
+representation-specific
+@context
+entry. The serialized value of
+@context
+MUST
+be the
+JSON
+String
+https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1
+, or a
+JSON Array
+where the first item is the
+JSON String
+https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1
+and the subsequent items are
+serialized according to the JSON
+representation
+production
+rules.
+Example
+22
+: A valid serialization of a simple @context entry
+{
+"@context"
+:
+"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"
+,
+...
+}
+Example
+23
+: A valid serialization of a layered @context entry
+{
+"@context"
+: [
+"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"
+,
+"https://did-method-extension.example/v1"
+],
+...
+}
+All implementers creating
+conforming producers
+that produce JSON-LD
+representations
+are advised to ensure that their algorithms
+produce valid JSON-LD [
+JSON-LD11
+] documents. Invalid JSON-LD documents will
+cause JSON-LD processors to halt and report errors.
+In order to achieve interoperability across different
+representations
+,
+all JSON-LD Contexts and their terms
+SHOULD
+be registered in the DID
+Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+].
+A
+conforming producer
+that generates a JSON-LD
+representation
+SHOULD NOT
+produce a
+DID document
+that contains terms not defined via the
+@context
+as
+conforming consumers
+are expected to remove
+unknown terms. When serializing a JSON-LD
+representation
+of a
+DID
+document
+, a
+conforming producer
+MUST
+specify a media type of
+application/did+ld+json
+to downstream applications such as
+described in
+7.1.2
+DID Resolution Metadata
+.
+6.3.2
+Consumption
+The
+DID document
+and any DID document data structures expressed by a
+JSON-LD
+representation
+MUST
+be deserialized into the
+data model
+according to the JSON
+representation
+consumption
+rules as defined in
+6.2
+JSON
+.
+All implementers creating
+conforming consumers
+that consume JSON-LD
+representations
+are advised to ensure that their algorithms only accept
+valid JSON-LD [
+JSON-LD11
+] documents. Invalid JSON-LD documents will cause
+JSON-LD processors to halt and report errors.
+Conforming consumers
+that process a JSON-LD
+representation
+SHOULD
+drop all terms from a
+DID document
+that are not defined via the
+@context
+.
+7.
+Resolution
+This section defines the inputs and outputs of
+DID resolution
+and
+DID
+URL dereferencing
+. Their exact implementation is out of scope for this
+specification, but some considerations for implementers are discussed in
+[
+DID-RESOLUTION
+].
+All conformant
+DID resolvers
+MUST
+implement the
+DID resolution
+functions for at least one
+DID method
+and
+MUST
+be able to return a
+DID document
+in at least one conformant
+representation
+.
+7.1
+DID Resolution
+The
+DID resolution
+functions resolve a
+DID
+into a
+DID
+document
+by using the "Read" operation of the applicable
+DID method
+as described in
+8.2
+Method Operations
+. The details of how this
+process is accomplished are outside the scope of this specification, but all
+conforming
+DID resolvers
+implement the functions below, which have the
+following abstract forms:
+resolve(did, resolutionOptions) →
+« didResolutionMetadata, didDocument, didDocumentMetadata »
+resolveRepresentation(did, resolutionOptions) →
+« didResolutionMetadata, didDocumentStream, didDocumentMetadata »

+The input variables
+of the
+resolve
+and

+functions are
+as follows:
+did
+This is the
+DID
+to resolve. This input is
+REQUIRED
+and the value
+MUST
+be a conformant
+DID
+as defined in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+.
+resolutionOptions
+A
+metadata structure
+containing properties
+defined in
+7.1.1
+DID Resolution Options
+. This input is
+REQUIRED
+, but the structure
+MAY
+be empty.
+These functions each return multiple values, and no limitations
+are placed on how these values are returned together.
+The return values of
+resolve
+are
+didResolutionMetadata
+,
+didDocument
+, and
+didDocumentMetadata
+. The return values of
+resolveRepresentation
+are
+didResolutionMetadata
+,
+didDocumentStream
+, and
+didDocumentMetadata
+. These values are described below:
+didResolutionMetadata
+A
+metadata structure
+consisting of values
+relating to the results of the
+DID resolution
+process which typically
+changes between invocations of the
+resolve
+and
+resolveRepresentation
+functions, as it represents data about the
+resolution process itself. This structure is
+REQUIRED
+, and in the case of an
+error in the resolution process, this
+MUST NOT
+be empty. This metadata is
+defined by
+7.1.2
+DID Resolution Metadata
+. If
+resolveRepresentation
+was called, this structure
+MUST
+contain a
+contentType
+property containing the Media Type of the
+representation found in the
+didDocumentStream
+. If the resolution is
+not successful, this structure
+MUST
+contain an
+error
+property
+describing the error.
+didDocument
+If the resolution is successful, and if the
+resolve
+function was
+called, this
+MUST
+be a
+DID document
+abstract data model (a
+map
+) as described in
+4.
+Data Model
+that
+is capable of being transformed into a
+conforming DID Document
+(representation), using the production rules specified by the representation.
+The value of
+id
+in the resolved
+DID document
+MUST
+match the
+DID
+that was resolved. If the resolution is unsuccessful, this
+value
+MUST
+be empty.
+didDocumentStream
+If the resolution is successful, and if the
+resolveRepresentation
+function was called, this
+MUST
+be a byte stream of the resolved
+DID
+document
+in one of the conformant
+representations
+. The byte stream might then be
+parsed by the caller of the
+resolveRepresentation
+function into a
+data model
+, which can in turn be validated and
+processed. If the resolution is unsuccessful, this value
+MUST
+be an empty
+stream.
+didDocumentMetadata
+If the resolution is successful, this
+MUST
+be a
+metadata structure
+. This structure contains
+metadata about the
+DID document
+contained in the
+didDocument
+property. This metadata typically does not change between invocations of the
+resolve
+and
+resolveRepresentation
+functions unless the
+DID document
+changes, as it represents metadata about the
+DID
+document
+. If the resolution is unsuccessful, this output
+MUST
+be an empty
+metadata structure
+. Properties defined by this
+specification are in
+7.1.3
+DID Document Metadata
+.
+Conforming
+DID resolver
+implementations do not alter the signature of
+these functions in any way.
+DID resolver
+implementations might map the
+resolve
+and

+7.1.1
+DID Resolution Options
+The possible properties within this structure and their possible values are
+registered in the DID Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+]. This
+specification defines the following common properties.
+accept
+The Media Type of the caller's preferred
+representation
+of the
+DID
+document
+. The Media Type
+MUST
+be expressed as an
+ASCII string
+. The
+DID resolver
+implementation
+SHOULD
+use this
+value to determine the
+representation
+contained in the returned
+didDocumentStream
+if such a
+representation
+is supported and
+available. This property is
+OPTIONAL
+for the
+resolveRepresentation
+function and
+MUST NOT
+be used with the
+resolve
+function.
+7.1.2
+DID Resolution Metadata
+The possible properties within this structure and their possible values are
+registered in the DID Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+]. This
+specification defines the following DID resolution metadata properties:
+contentType
+The Media Type of the returned
+didDocumentStream
+. This property is
+REQUIRED
+if resolution is successful and if the
+resolveRepresentation
+function was called.
+This property
+MUST NOT
+be present if the
+resolve
+function was called. The value of this
+property
+MUST
+be an
+ASCII string
+that is the Media
+Type of the conformant
+representations
+. The
+caller of the
+resolveRepresentation
+function
+MUST
+use this value
+when determining how to parse and process the
+didDocumentStream
+returned by this function into the
+data model
+.
+error
+The error code from the resolution process. This property is
+REQUIRED
+when there
+is an error in the resolution process. The value of this property
+MUST
+be a
+single keyword
+ASCII string
+. The possible property
+values of this field
+SHOULD
+be registered in the DID Specification Registries
+[
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+]. This specification defines the following
+common error values:
+invalidDid
+The
+DID
+supplied to the
+DID resolution
+function does not conform
+to valid syntax. (See
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+.)
+notFound
+The
+DID resolver
+was unable to find the
+DID document
+resulting from this resolution request.
+representationNotSupported
+This error code is returned if the
+representation
+requested via the
+accept
+input metadata property is not supported by the
+DID
+method
+and/or
+DID resolver
+implementation.
+7.1.3
+DID Document Metadata
+The possible properties within this structure and their possible values
+SHOULD
+be registered in the DID Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+].
+This specification defines the following common properties.
+created
+DID document
+metadata
+SHOULD
+include a
+created
+property to
+indicate the timestamp of the
+Create operation
+.
+The value of the property
+MUST
+be a
+string
+formatted as an
+XML Datetime
+normalized to UTC 00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision. For
+example:
+2020-12-20T19:17:47Z
+.
+updated
+DID document
+metadata
+SHOULD
+include an
+updated
+property to
+indicate the timestamp of the last
+Update
+operation
+for the document version which was resolved. The value of the
+property
+MUST
+follow the same formatting rules as the
+created
+property. The
+updated
+property is omitted if an Update operation
+has never been performed on the
+DID document
+. If an
+updated
+property exists, it can be the same value as the
+created
+property
+when the difference between the two timestamps is less than one second.
+deactivated
+If a DID has been
+deactivated
+,
+DID document
+metadata
+MUST
+include this property with the boolean value
+true
+. If a DID has not been deactivated, this property is
+OPTIONAL
+,
+but if included,
+MUST
+have the boolean value
+false
+.
+nextUpdate
+DID document
+metadata
+MAY
+include a
+nextUpdate
+property if
+the resolved document version is not the latest version of the document. It
+indicates the timestamp of the next
+Update
+operation
+. The value of the property
+MUST
+follow the same formatting rules
+as the
+created
+property.
+versionId
+DID document
+metadata
+SHOULD
+include a
+versionId
+property to
+indicate the version of the last
+Update
+operation
+for the document version which was resolved. The value of the
+property
+MUST
+be an
+ASCII string
+.
+nextVersionId
+DID document
+metadata
+MAY
+include a
+nextVersionId
+property
+if the resolved document version is not the latest version of the document. It
+indicates the version of the next
+Update
+operation
+. The value of the property
+MUST
+be an
+ASCII string
+.
+equivalentId
+A
+DID method
+can define different forms of a
+DID
+that are
+logically equivalent. An example is when a
+DID
+takes one form prior to
+registration in a
+verifiable data registry
+and another form after such
+registration. In this case, the
+DID method
+specification might need to
+express one or more
+DIDs
+that are logically equivalent to the resolved
+DID
+as a property of the
+DID document
+. This is the purpose of the
+equivalentId
+property.
+DID document
+metadata
+MAY
+include an
+equivalentId
+property.
+If present, the value
+MUST
+be a
+set
+where each item is a
+string
+that conforms to the rules in Section
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. The relationship is a statement that each
+equivalentId
+value is logically equivalent to the
+id
+property value and thus refers to the same
+DID subject
+.
+Each
+equivalentId
+DID value
+MUST
+be produced by, and a form
+of, the same
+DID method
+as the
+id
+property value. (e.g.,
+did:example:abc
+==
+did:example:ABC
+)
+A conforming
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+guarantee that each
+equivalentId
+value is logically equivalent to the
+id
+property value.
+A requesting party is expected to retain the values from the
+id
+and
+equivalentId
+properties to ensure any subsequent
+interactions with any of the values they contain are correctly handled as
+logically equivalent (e.g., retain all variants in a database so an interaction
+with any one maps to the same underlying account).
+Note
+: Stronger equivalence
+equivalentId
+is a much stronger form of equivalence than
+alsoKnownAs
+because the equivalence
+MUST
+be guaranteed by
+the governing
+DID method
+.
+equivalentId
+represents a
+full graph merge because the same
+DID document
+describes both the
+equivalentId
+DID
+and the
+id
+property
+DID
+.
+If a requesting party does not retain the values from the
+id
+and
+equivalentId
+properties and ensure any subsequent
+interactions with any of the values they contain are correctly handled as
+logically equivalent, there might be negative or unexpected issues that
+arise. Implementers are strongly advised to observe the
+directives related to this metadata property.
+canonicalId
+The
+canonicalId
+property is identical to the
+equivalentId
+property except: a) it is associated with a
+single value rather than a set, and b) the
+DID
+is defined to be
+the canonical ID for the
+DID subject
+within the scope of the containing
+DID document
+.
+DID document
+metadata
+MAY
+include a
+canonicalId
+property.
+If present, the value
+MUST
+be a
+string
+that conforms to the rules in Section
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. The relationship is a statement that the
+canonicalId
+value is logically equivalent to the
+id
+property value and that the
+canonicalId
+value is defined by the
+DID method
+to be the canonical ID for the
+DID
+subject
+in the scope of the containing
+DID document
+. A
+canonicalId
+value
+MUST
+be produced by, and a form of, the
+same
+DID method
+as the
+id
+property value. (e.g.,
+did:example:abc
+==
+did:example:ABC
+).
+A conforming
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+guarantee that the
+canonicalId
+value is logically equivalent to the
+id
+property value.
+A requesting party is expected to use the
+canonicalId
+value
+as its primary ID value for the
+DID subject
+and treat all other
+equivalent values as secondary aliases (e.g., update corresponding primary
+references in their systems to reflect the new canonical ID directive).
+Note
+: Canonical equivalence
+canonicalId
+is the same statement of equivalence as
+equivalentId
+except it is constrained to a single value that
+is defined to be canonical for the
+DID subject
+in the scope of the
+DID
+document
+. Like
+equivalentId
+,
+canonicalId
+represents a full graph merge because the same
+DID document
+describes both the
+canonicalId
+DID and
+the
+id
+property
+DID
+.
+If a resolving party does not use the
+canonicalId
+value as
+its primary ID value for the DID subject and treat all other equivalent values
+as secondary aliases, there might be negative or unexpected issues that arise
+related to user experience. Implementers are strongly advised to observe the
+directives related to this metadata property.
+7.2
+DID URL Dereferencing
+The
+DID URL dereferencing
+function dereferences a
+DID URL
+into a
+resource
+with contents depending on the
+DID URL
+'s components,
+including the
+DID method
+, method-specific identifier, path, query, and
+fragment. This process depends on
+DID resolution
+of the
+DID
+contained in the
+DID URL
+.
+DID URL dereferencing
+might involve
+multiple steps (e.g., when the DID URL being dereferenced includes a fragment),
+and the function is defined to return the final resource after all steps are
+completed. The details of how this process is accomplished are outside the scope
+of this specification. The following figure depicts the relationship described
+above.

+All conforming
+DID resolvers
+implement
+the following function which has the following abstract form:
+dereference(didUrl, dereferenceOptions) →
+« dereferencingMetadata, contentStream, contentMetadata »
+The input variables of the
+dereference
+function are as follows:
+didUrl
+A conformant
+DID URL
+as a single
+string
+.
+This is the
+DID URL
+to dereference. To dereference a
+DID fragment
+,
+the complete
+DID URL
+including the
+DID fragment
+MUST
+be used. This
+input is
+REQUIRED
+.
+Note
+: DID URL dereferencer patterns
+While it is valid for any
+didUrl
+to be passed to a DID URL
+dereferencer, implementers are expected to refer to [

+MAY
+be a
+resource

+If the dereferencing is unsuccessful, this value
+MUST
+be empty.
+contentMetadata
+If the dereferencing is successful, this
+MUST
+be a
+metadata structure
+, but the structure

+MUST
+be an empty
+metadata structure
+.
+Conforming
+DID URL dereferencing
+implementations do not alter the
+signature of these functions in any way.
+DID URL dereferencing
+implementations might map the
+dereference
+function to a
+method-specific internal function to perform the actual
+DID URL
+dereferencing
+process.
+DID URL dereferencing
+implementations might
+implement and expose additional functions with different signatures in addition
+to the

+7.2.1
+DID URL Dereferencing Options
+The possible properties within this structure and their possible values
+SHOULD
+be registered in the DID Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+].
+This specification defines the following common properties for
+dereferencing options:
+accept
+The Media Type that the caller prefers for
+contentStream
+. The Media
+Type
+MUST
+be expressed as an
+ASCII string
+. The
+DID URL dereferencing
+implementation
+SHOULD
+use this value to determine
+the
+contentType
+of the
+representation
+contained in the
+returned value if such a
+representation
+is supported and available.
+7.2.2
+DID URL Dereferencing Metadata
+The possible properties within this structure and their possible values are
+registered in the DID Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+]. This
+specification defines the following common properties.
+contentType
+The Media Type of the returned
+contentStream
+SHOULD
+be expressed
+using this property if dereferencing is successful. The Media
+Type value
+MUST
+be expressed as an
+ASCII string
+.
+error
+The error code from the dereferencing process. This property is
+REQUIRED
+when
+there is an error in the dereferencing process. The value of this property
+MUST
+be a single keyword expressed as an
+ASCII
+string
+. The possible property values of this field
+SHOULD
+be registered in
+the DID Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+]. This specification
+defines the following common error values:
+invalidDidUrl
+The
+DID URL
+supplied to the
+DID URL dereferencing
+function does
+not conform to valid syntax. (See

+7.3
+Metadata Structure
+Input and output metadata is often involved during the
+DID Resolution
+,
+DID URL dereferencing
+, and other DID-related processes. The structure
+used to communicate this metadata
+MUST
+be a
+map
+of properties. Each property name
+MUST
+be a
+string
+. Each property value
+MUST
+be a
+string
+,
+map
+,
+list
+,
+set
+,
+boolean
+, or
+null
+. The values within any complex data
+structures such as maps and lists
+MUST
+be one of these data types as well.
+All metadata property definitions registered in the DID Specification
+Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+]
+MUST
+define the value type, including any
+additional formats or restrictions to that value (for example, a string
+formatted as a date or as a decimal integer). It is
+RECOMMENDED
+that property
+definitions use strings for values. The entire metadata structure
+MUST
+be
+serializable according to the
+JSON
+serialization rules
+in the [
+INFRA
+] specification. Implementations
+MAY
+serialize the metadata structure to other data formats.
+All implementations of functions that use metadata structures as either input or
+output are able to fully represent all data types described here in a
+deterministic fashion. As inputs and outputs using metadata structures are
+defined in terms of data types and not their serialization, the method for
+representation
+is internal to the implementation of the function and is
+out of scope of this specification.
+The following example demonstrates a JSON-encoded metadata structure that
+might be used as
+DID
+resolution input metadata
+.
+Example
+24
+: JSON-encoded DID resolution input metadata example
+{
+"accept"
+:
+"application/did+ld+json"
+}
+This example corresponds to a metadata structure of the following format:
+Example
+25
+: DID resolution input metadata example
+«[
+"accept"
+→
+"application/did+ld+json"
+]»
+The next example demonstrates a JSON-encoded metadata structure that might be
+used as
+DID resolution
+metadata
+if a
+DID
+was not found.

+Methods
+A
+DID method
+defines how implementers can realize the features
+described by this specification.
+DID methods
+are often associated with a
+particular
+verifiable data registry
+. New
+DID methods
+are defined
+in their own specifications to enable interoperability between different
+implementations of the same
+DID method
+.
+Conceptually, the relationship between this specification and a
+DID
+method
+specification is similar to the relationship between the IETF generic
+URI
+specification [
+RFC3986
+] and a specific
+URI
+scheme
+[
+IANA-URI-SCHEMES
+], such as the
+http
+scheme [
+RFC7230
+]. In
+addition to defining a specific
+DID scheme
+, a
+DID method
+specification also defines the mechanisms for creating, resolving, updating, and
+deactivating
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+using a specific type of
+verifiable data registry
+. It also documents all implementation
+considerations related to
+DIDs
+as well as Security and Privacy
+Considerations.
+This section specifies the requirements for authoring
+DID method
+specifications.
+8.1
+Method Syntax
+The requirements for all
+DID method
+specifications when defining the
+method-specific DID Syntax are as follows:
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+define exactly one method-specific
+DID
+scheme
+that is identified by exactly one method name as specified by the
+method-name
+rule in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+.
+The
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+specify how to generate the
+method-specific-id
+component of a
+DID
+.
+The
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+define sensitivity and normalization of
+the value of the
+method-specific-id
+.
+The
+method-specific-id
+value
+MUST
+be unique within a
+DID
+method
+. The
+method-specific-id
+value itself might be globally
+unique.
+Any
+DID
+generated by a
+DID method
+MUST
+be globally unique.
+To reduce the chances of
+method-name
+conflicts, a
+DID method
+specification
+SHOULD
+be registered in the DID Specification Registries
+[
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+].
+A
+DID method
+MAY
+define multiple
+method-specific-id
+formats.
+The
+method-specific-id
+format
+MAY
+include colons. The use of
+colons
+MUST
+comply syntactically with the
+method-specific-id
+ABNF
+rule.
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MAY
+specify ABNF rules for
+DID paths
+that are more restrictive than the generic rules in
+Path
+.
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MAY
+specify ABNF rules for
+DID queries
+that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MAY
+specify ABNF rules for
+DID
+fragments
+that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
+Note
+: Colons in method-specific-id
+The meaning of colons in the
+method-specific-id
+is entirely
+method-specific. Colons might be used by
+DID methods
+for establishing
+hierarchically partitioned namespaces, for identifying specific instances or
+parts of the
+verifiable data registry
+, or for other purposes.
+Implementers are advised to avoid assuming any meanings or
+behaviors associated with a colon that are generically applicable to all
+DID methods
+.
+8.2
+Method Operations
+The requirements for all
+DID method
+specifications when defining the
+method operations are as follows:
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+define how authorization is performed to
+execute all operations, including any necessary cryptographic processes.
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+specify how a
+DID controller
+creates a
+DID
+and its associated
+DID document
+.
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+specify how a
+DID resolver
+uses a
+DID
+to resolve a
+DID document
+, including how the
+DID
+resolver
+can verify the authenticity of the response.
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+specify what constitutes an update to a
+DID document
+and how a
+DID controller
+can update a
+DID
+document
+or
+state that updates are not possible.
+The
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+specify how a
+DID controller
+can
+deactivate a
+DID
+or
+state that deactivation is not possible.
+The authority of a party that is performing authorization to carry out the
+operations is specific to a
+DID method
+. For example, a
+DID method
+might —
+make use of the
+controller
+property.
+use the
+verification methods
+listed under
+authentication
+.
+use other constructs in the
+DID Document
+such as the
+verification
+method
+specified via the
+capabilityInvocation
+verification relationship
+.
+not use the
+DID document
+for this decision at all, and depend on an
+out-of-band mechanism, instead.
+8.3
+Security Requirements
+The requirements for all
+DID method
+specifications when authoring the
+Security Considerations
+section are as follows:
+A
+DID method
+specifications
+MUST
+follow all guidelines and normative
+language provided in
+RFC3552: Writing Security
+Considerations Sections
+for the
+DID
+operations defined in the
+DID
+method
+specification.
+The Security Considerations section
+MUST
+document the following forms of attack
+for the
+DID
+operations defined in the
+DID method
+specification:
+eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, denial of
+service,
+amplification
+, and man-in-the-middle. Other known
+forms of attack
+SHOULD
+also be documented.
+The Security Considerations section
+MUST
+discuss residual risks, such as the
+risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation, or cipher
+after threat mitigation was deployed.
+The Security Considerations section
+MUST
+provide integrity protection and update
+authentication for all operations required by Section
+8.2
+Method Operations
+.
+If authentication is involved, particularly user-host authentication, the
+security characteristics of the authentication method
+MUST
+be clearly
+documented.
+The Security Considerations section
+MUST
+discuss the policy mechanism by which
+DIDs
+are proven to be uniquely assigned.
+Method-specific endpoint authentication
+MUST
+be discussed. Where
+DID
+methods
+make use of
+DLTs
+with varying network topology, sometimes
+offered as
+light node
+or
+thin client
+implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security assumptions
+of the topology available to implementations of the
+DID method
+MUST
+be
+discussed.
+If a protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, the
+DID
+method
+specification
+MUST
+clearly indicate which portions of the data are
+protected and by what protections, and it
+SHOULD
+give an indication of the
+sorts of attacks to which the cryptographic protection is susceptible. Some
+examples are integrity only, confidentiality, and endpoint authentication.
+Data which is to be held secret (keying material, random seeds, and so on)
+SHOULD
+be clearly labeled.
+DID method
+specifications
+SHOULD
+explain and specify the implementation
+of signatures on
+DID documents
+, if applicable.
+Where
+DID methods
+use peer-to-peer computing resources, such as with all
+known
+DLTs
+, the expected burdens of those resources
+SHOULD
+be discussed
+in relation to denial of service.
+DID methods
+that introduce new authentication
+service
+types, as described in
+5.4
+Services
+,
+SHOULD
+consider the
+security requirements of the supported authentication protocol.
+8.4
+Privacy Requirements
+The requirements for all
+DID method
+specifications when authoring the
+Privacy Considerations
+section are:
+The
+DID method
+specification's Privacy Considerations section
+MUST
+discuss any subsection of Section 5 of [
+RFC6973
+] that could apply in a
+method-specific manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored
+data compromise, unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation,
+identification, secondary use, disclosure, and exclusion.
+9.
+Security Considerations
+This section is non-normative.
+This section contains a variety of security considerations that people using
+Decentralized Identifiers are advised to consider before deploying this
+technology in a production setting.
+DIDs
+are designed to operate under
+the threat model used by many IETF standards and documented
+in [
+RFC3552
+]. This section elaborates upon a number of the considerations
+in [
+RFC3552
+], as well as other considerations that are unique to
+DID
+architecture.
+9.1
+Choosing DID Resolvers
+The DID Specification Registries [
+DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES
+] contains an
+informative list of
+DID method
+names and their corresponding
+DID
+method
+specifications. Implementers need to bear in mind that there is no
+central authority to mandate which
+DID method
+specification is to be used
+with any specific
+DID method
+name. If there is doubt on whether or not a
+specific
+DID resolver
+implements a
+DID method
+correctly, the DID
+Specification Registries can be used to look up the registered specification
+and make an informed decision regarding which
+DID resolver
+implementation to use.
+9.2
+Proving Control and Binding
+Binding an entity in the digital world or the physical world to a
+DID
+, to
+a
+DID document
+, or to cryptographic material requires, the use of
+security protocols contemplated by this specification. The following sections
+describe some possible scenarios and how an entity therein might prove control
+over a
+DID
+or a
+DID document
+for the purposes of authentication or
+authorization.
+Proving Control of a DID and/or DID Document
+Proving control over a
+DID
+and/or a
+DID Document
+is useful when
+updating either in a
+verifiable data registry
+or authenticating with
+remote systems. Cryptographic digital signatures and
+verifiable
+timestamps
+enable certain security protocols related to
+DID documents
+to be cryptographically verifiable. For these purposes, this specification
+defines useful
+verification relationships
+in
+5.3.1
+Authentication
+and
+5.3.4
+Capability Invocation
+. The
+secret cryptographic material associated with the
+verification methods
+can be used to generate a cryptographic digital signature as a part of an
+authentication or authorization security protocol.
+Note
+: Signed DID documents
+Some
+DID methods
+allow digital signatures and other proofs to be
+included in the
+DID document
+or a
+7.3
+Metadata Structure
+.
+However, such proofs by themselves do not necessarily prove control over a
+DID
+, or guarantee that the
+DID document
+is the correct one for
+the
+DID
+. In order to obtain
+the correct
+DID document
+and verify control over a
+DID
+, it is
+necessary to perform the
+DID resolution
+process as defined by the
+DID method
+.
+Binding to Physical Identity
+A
+DID
+and
+DID document
+do not inherently carry any
+personal data
+and
+it is strongly advised that non-public entities do not publish personal data in
+DID documents
+.
+It can be useful to express a binding of a
+DID
+to a person's or
+organization's physical identity in a way that is provably asserted by a
+trusted authority, such as a government. This specification provides
+the
+5.3.2
+Assertion
+verification relationship
+for these
+purposes. This feature can enable interactions that are private and can be
+considered legally enforceable under one or more jurisdictions; establishing
+such bindings has to be carefully balanced against privacy considerations (see
+10.
+Privacy Considerations
+).
+The process of binding a
+DID
+to something in the physical world, such as
+a person or an organization — for example, by using
+verifiable
+credentials
+with the same subject as that
+DID
+— is contemplated
+by this specification and further defined in the Verifiable Credentials Data
+Model [
+VC-DATA-MODEL
+].
+9.3
+Authentication Service Endpoints
+If a
+DID document
+publishes a
+service
+intended for
+authentication or authorization of the
+DID subject
+(see Section
+5.4
+Services
+), it is the responsibility of the
+service
+endpoint
+provider, subject, or requesting party to comply with the
+requirements of the authentication protocols supported at that
+service
+endpoint
+.
+9.4
+Non-Repudiation
+Non-repudiation of
+DIDs
+and
+DID document
+updates is supported if:
+The
+verifiable data registry
+supports
+verifiable timestamps
+. See
+7.1.3
+DID Document Metadata
+for further information on useful timestamps that can be used during the
+DID resolution
+process.
+The subject is monitoring for unauthorized updates as elaborated upon in
+9.5
+Notification of DID Document Changes
+.
+The subject has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious updates according
+to the authorization mechanism for the
+DID method
+.
+9.5
+Notification of DID Document Changes
+One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a
+DID document
+is
+monitoring and actively notifying the
+DID subject
+when there are changes.
+This is analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
+username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to the email
+addresses on file.
+In the case of a
+DID
+, there is no intermediary registrar or account
+provider to generate such notifications. However, if the
+verifiable data
+registry
+on which the
+DID
+is registered directly supports change
+notifications, a subscription service can be offered to
+DID controllers
+.
+Notifications could be sent directly to the relevant
+service endpoints
+listed in an existing
+DID
+.
+If a
+DID controller
+chooses to rely on a third-party monitoring service
+(other than the
+verifiable data registry
+itself), this introduces another
+vector of attack.
+9.6
+Key and Signature Expiration
+In a
+decentralized identifier
+architecture, there might not be
+centralized authorities to enforce cryptographic material or cryptographic
+digital signature expiration policies. Therefore, it is with supporting software
+such as
+DID resolvers
+and verification libraries that requesting parties
+validate that cryptographic material were not expired at the time they were
+used. Requesting parties might employ their own expiration policies in addition
+to inputs into their verification processes. For example, some requesting
+parties might accept authentications from five minutes in the past, while others
+with access to high precision time sources might require authentications to be
+time stamped within the last 500 milliseconds.
+There are some requesting parties that have legitimate needs to extend the use
+of already-expired cryptographic material, such as verifying legacy
+cryptographic digital signatures. In these scenarios, a requesting party might
+instruct their verification software to ignore cryptographic key material
+expiration or determine if the cryptographic key material was expired at the
+time it was used.
+9.7
+Verification Method Rotation
+Rotation is a management process that enables the secret cryptographic material
+associated with an existing
+verification method
+to be deactivated or
+destroyed once a new
+verification method
+has been added to the
+DID
+document
+. Going forward, any new proofs that a
+controller
+would have
+generated using the old secret cryptographic material can now instead be
+generated using the new  cryptographic material and can be verified using the
+new
+verification method
+.
+Rotation is a useful mechanism for protecting against verification method
+compromise, since frequent rotation of a verification method by the controller
+reduces the value of a single compromised verification method to an attacker.
+Performing revocation immediately after rotation is useful for verification
+methods that a controller designates for short-lived verifications, such as
+those involved in encrypting messages and authentication.
+The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of
+verification method
+rotation:
+Verification method
+rotation is a proactive security measure.
+It is generally considered a best practice to perform
+verification method
+rotation on a regular basis.
+Higher security environments tend to employ more frequent verification method
+rotation.
+Verification method
+rotation manifests only as changes to the current or
+latest version of a
+DID document
+.
+When a
+verification method
+has been active for a long time, or used for
+many operations, a controller might wish to perform a rotation.
+Frequent rotation of a
+verification method
+might be frustrating for
+parties that are forced to continuously renew or refresh associated credentials.
+Proofs or signatures that rely on
+verification methods
+that are not
+present in the latest version of a
+DID document
+are not impacted by
+rotation. In these cases, verification software might require additional
+information, such as when a particular
+verification method
+was
+expected to be valid as well as access to a
+verifiable data registry
+containing a historical record, to determine the validity of the proof or
+signature. This option might not be available in all
+DID methods
+.
+The section on
+DID method operations
+specifies
+the
+DID
+operations to be supported by a
+DID method
+specification,
+including
+update
+which is expected to be used
+to perform a
+verification method
+rotation.
+A
+controller
+performs a rotation when they add a new
+verification
+method
+that is meant to replace an existing
+verification method
+after
+some time.
+Not all
+DID methods
+support
+verification method
+rotation.
+9.8
+Verification Method Revocation
+Revocation is a management process that enables the secret cryptographic
+material associated with an existing
+verification method
+to be
+deactivated such that it ceases to be a valid form of creating new
+proofs of digital signatures.
+Revocation is a useful mechanism for reacting to a verification method
+compromise. Performing revocation immediately after rotation is useful for
+verification methods that a controller designates for short-lived verifications,
+such as those involved in encrypting messages and authentication.
+Compromise of the secrets associated with a
+verification method
+allows
+the attacker to use them according to the
+verification relationship
+expressed by
+controller
+in the
+DID document
+, for example, for
+authentication. The attacker's use of the secrets might be indistinguishable
+from the legitimate
+controller's
+use starting from
+the time the
+verification method
+was registered, to the time it was
+revoked.
+The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of
+verification method
+revocation:
+Verification method
+revocation is a reactive security measure.
+It is considered a best practice to support key revocation.
+A
+controller
+is expected to immediately revoke any
+verification
+method
+that is known to be compromised.
+Verification method
+revocation can only be embodied in changes to
+the latest version of a
+DID Document
+; it cannot retroactively adjust
+previous versions.
+As described in
+5.2.1
+Verification Material
+, absence of a verification
+method is the only form of revocation that applies to all
+DID Methods
+that support revocation.
+If a
+verification method
+is no longer exclusively accessible to the
+controller
+or parties trusted to act on behalf of the
+controller
+,
+it is expected to be revoked immediately to reduce the risk of
+compromises such as masquerading, theft, and fraud.
+Revocation is expected to be understood as a
+controller
+expressing that
+proofs or signatures associated with a revoked
+verification method
+created after its revocation should be treated as invalid. It could also imply a
+concern that existing proofs or signatures might have been created by an
+attacker, but this is not necessarily the case. Verifiers, however, might still
+choose to accept or reject any such proofs or signatures at their own
+discretion.
+The section on
+DID method operations
+specifies
+the
+DID
+operations to be supported by a
+DID method
+specification,
+including
+update
+and
+deactivate
+, which might be used to remove
+a
+verification method
+from a
+DID document
+.
+Not all
+DID methods
+support
+verification method
+revocation.
+Even if a
+verification method
+is present in a
+DID document
+,
+additional information, such as a public key revocation certificate, or an
+external allow or deny list, could be used to determine whether a
+verification method
+has been revoked.
+The day-to-day operation of any software relying on a compromised
+verification method
+, such as an individual's operating system, antivirus,
+or endpoint protection software, could be impacted when the
+verification
+method
+is publicly revoked.
+Revocation Semantics
+Although verifiers might choose not to accept proofs or signatures from a
+revoked verification method, knowing whether a verification was made with a
+revoked
+verification method
+is trickier than it might seem. Some
+DID
+methods
+provide the ability to look back at the state of a
+DID
+at a
+point in time, or at a particular version of the
+DID document
+. When such
+a feature is combined with a reliable way to determine the time or
+DID
+version that existed when a cryptographically verifiable statement was made,
+then revocation does not undo that statement. This can be the basis for using
+DIDs
+to make binding commitments; for example, to sign a mortgage.
+If these conditions are met, revocation is not retroactive; it only nullifies
+future use of the method.
+However, in order for such semantics to be safe, the second condition — an
+ability to know what the state of the
+DID document
+was at the time the
+assertion was made — is expected to apply. Without that guarantee, someone
+could discover a revoked key and use it to make cryptographically verifiable
+statements with a simulated date in the past.
+Some
+DID methods
+only allow the retrieval of the current state of a
+DID
+. When this is true, or when the state of a
+DID
+at the time of
+a cryptographically verifiable statement cannot be reliably determined, then the
+only safe course is to disallow any consideration of DID state with respect to
+time, except the present moment.
+DID
+ecosystems that take this approach
+essentially provide cryptographically verifiable statements as ephemeral tokens
+that can be invalidated at any time by the
+DID controller
+.
+Revocation in Trustless Systems
+Trustless systems are those where all trust is derived from cryptographically
+provable assertions, and more specifically, where no metadata outside of the
+cryptographic system is factored into the determination of trust in the system.
+To verify a signature of proof for a
+verification method
+which has been
+revoked in a trustless system, a
+DID method
+needs to support either or
+both of the
+versionId
+or
+versionTime
+, as well as both the
+updated
+and
+nextUpdate
+,
+DID document
+metadata properties. A verifier can validate a
+signature or proof of a revoked key if and only if all of the following are
+true:
+The proof or signature includes the
+versionId
+or
+versionTime
+of the
+DID
+document
+that was used at the point the signature or proof was created.
+The verifier can determine the point in time at which the signature or proof was
+made; for example, it was anchored on a blockchain.
+For the resolved
+DID document
+metadata, the
+updated
+timestamp is
+before, and the
+nextUpdate
+timestamp is after, the point in time at which the
+signature or proof was made.
+In systems that are willing to admit metadata other than those constituting
+cryptographic input, similar trust may be achieved -- but always on the
+same basis where a careful judgment is made about whether a
+DID document
+'s content at the moment of a signing event
+contained the expected content.
+9.9
+DID Recovery
+Recovery is a reactive security measure whereby a
+controller
+that has
+lost the ability to perform DID operations, such as through the loss of a
+device, is able to regain the ability to perform DID operations.
+The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of
+DID
+recovery:
+Performing recovery proactively on an infrequent but regular basis, can help to
+ensure that control has not been lost.
+It is considered a best practice to never reuse cryptographic material
+associated with recovery for any other purposes.
+Recovery is commonly performed in conjunction with
+verification method rotation
+and
+verification method revocation
+.
+Recovery is advised when a
+controller
+or services trusted to act on their
+behalf no longer have the exclusive ability to perform DID operations as
+described in
+8.2
+Method Operations
+.
+DID method
+specifications might choose to enable support for a quorum of
+trusted parties to facilitate recovery. Some of the facilities to do so are
+suggested in
+5.1.2
+DID Controller
+.
+Not all
+DID method
+specifications will recognize control from
+DIDs
+registered using other
+DID methods
+and they might restrict third-party
+control to
+DIDs
+that use the same method.
+Access control and recovery in a
+DID method
+specification can also
+include a time lock feature to protect against key compromise by maintaining a
+second track of control for recovery.
+There are currently no common recovery mechanisms that apply to all
+DID methods
+.
+9.10
+The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers
+DIDs
+achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central
+registration authority. This comes at the cost of human memorability.
+Algorithms capable of generating globally unambiguous identifiers
+produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This
+trade-off is often referred to as
+Zooko's
+Triangle
+.
+There are use cases where it is desirable to discover a
+DID
+when
+starting from a human-friendly identifier. For example, a natural language
+name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a
+DID controller
+,
+such as a mobile telephone number, email address, social media username, or
+blog URL. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to
+DIDs
+, and doing so in a way that can be verified and trusted, is
+outside the scope of this specification.
+Solutions to this problem are defined in separate specifications, such as
+[
+DNS-DID
+], that reference this specification. It is strongly recommended that
+such specifications carefully consider the:
+Numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly
+identifier for a target entity.
+Privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently
+correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.
+9.11
+DIDs as Enhanced URNs
+If desired by a
+DID controller
+, a
+DID
+or a
+DID URL
+is
+capable of acting as persistent, location-independent resource identifier.
+These sorts of identifiers
+are classified as Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and are defined in [
+RFC8141
+].
+DIDs
+are an enhanced form of URN that provide a
+cryptographically secure, location-independent identifier for a digital
+resource, while also providing metadata that enables retrieval. Due to the
+indirection between the
+DID document
+and the
+DID
+itself, the
+DID controller
+can adjust the actual location of the resource — or
+even provide the resource directly — without adjusting the
+DID
+.
+DIDs
+of this type can definitively verify that the resource retrieved is,
+in fact, the resource identified.
+A
+DID controller
+who intends to use a
+DID
+for this purpose is
+advised to follow the security considerations in [
+RFC8141
+]. In particular:
+The
+DID controller
+is expected to choose a
+DID method
+that
+supports the controller's requirements for persistence. The Decentralized
+Characteristics Rubric [
+DID-RUBRIC
+] is one tool available to help
+implementers decide upon the most suitable
+DID method
+.
+The
+DID controller
+is expected to publish its operational policies so
+requesting parties can determine the degree to which they can rely on the
+persistence of a
+DID
+controlled by that
+DID controller
+. In the
+absence of such policies, requesting parties are not expected to make any
+assumption about whether a
+DID
+is a persistent identifier for the same
+DID subject
+.
+9.12
+Immutability
+Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and the
+assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Immutability of
+DID documents
+can provide some security benefits. Individual
+DID methods
+ought to
+consider constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics they do not
+need. The more
+locked down
+a
+DID method
+is, while providing the
+same set of features, the less it can be manipulated by malicious actors.
+As an example, consider that a single edit to a
+DID document
+can change
+anything except the root
+id
+property of the document. But
+is it actually desirable for a
+service
+to change its
+type
+after it is defined? Or for a key to change its value? Or
+would it be better to require a new
+id
+when certain
+fundamental properties of an object change? Malicious takeovers of a website
+often aim for an outcome where the site keeps its host name identifier,
+but is subtly changed underneath. If certain properties of the site, such
+as the
+ASN
+associated with its IP address, were required by the specification to be
+immutable, anomaly detection would be easier, and attacks would be much
+harder and more expensive to carry out.
+For
+DID methods
+tied to a global source of truth, a direct,
+just-in-time lookup of the latest version of a
+DID document
+is always
+possible. However, it seems likely that layers of cache might eventually sit
+between a
+DID resolver
+and that source of truth. If they do, believing
+the attributes of an object in the
+DID document
+to have a given state
+when they are actually subtly different might invite exploits. This is
+particularly true if some lookups are of a full
+DID document
+, and
+others are of partial data where the larger context is assumed.
+9.13
+Encrypted Data in DID Documents
+Encryption algorithms have been known to fail due to advances in cryptography
+and computing power. Implementers are advised to assume that any encrypted data
+placed in a
+DID document
+might eventually be made available in clear text
+to the same audience to which the encrypted data is available. This is
+particularly pertinent if the
+DID document
+is public.
+Encrypting all or parts of a
+DID document
+is
+not
+an appropriate
+means to protect data in the long term. Similarly, placing encrypted data in
+a
+DID document
+is not an appropriate means to protect personal data.
+Given the caveats above, if encrypted data is included in a
+DID document
+,
+implementers are advised to not associate any correlatable information
+that could be used to infer a relationship between the encrypted data
+and an associated party. Examples of correlatable information include
+public keys of a receiving party, identifiers to digital assets known to be
+under the control of a receiving party, or human readable descriptions of a
+receiving party.
+9.14
+Equivalence Properties
+Given the
+equivalentId
+and
+canonicalId
+properties are generated by
+DID methods
+themselves, the same security and
+accuracy guarantees that apply to the resolved
+DID
+present in the
+id
+field of a
+DID document
+also apply to these properties.
+The
+alsoKnownAs
+property is not guaranteed to be an accurate
+statement of equivalence, and should not be relied upon without performing
+validation steps beyond the resolution of the
+DID document
+.
+The
+equivalentId
+and
+canonicalId
+properties express equivalence assertions to variants of a single
+DID
+produced by the same
+DID method
+and can be trusted to the extent the
+requesting party trusts the
+DID method
+and a conforming producer and
+resolver.
+The
+alsoKnownAs
+property permits an equivalence assertion to
+URIs
+that are not governed by the same
+DID method
+and cannot be
+trusted without performing verification steps outside of the governing
+DID
+method
+. See additional guidance in
+5.1.3
+Also Known As
+.
+As with any other security-related properties in the
+DID document
+,
+parties relying on any equivalence statement in a
+DID document
+should
+guard against the values of these properties being substituted by an attacker
+after the proper verification has been performed. Any write access to a
+DID
+document
+stored in memory or disk after verification has been performed is
+an attack vector that might circumvent verification unless the
+DID
+document
+is re-verified.
+9.15
+Content Integrity Protection
+DID documents
+which include links to external machine-readable content
+such as images, web pages, or schemas are vulnerable to tampering. It is
+strongly advised that external links are integrity protected using solutions
+such as a hashlink [
+HASHLINK
+]. External links are to be avoided if they
+cannot be integrity protected and the
+DID document
+'s integrity is
+dependent on the external link.
+One example of an external link where the integrity of the
+DID document
+itself could be affected is the JSON-LD Context [
+JSON-LD11
+]. To protect
+against compromise,
+DID document
+consumers are advised to cache local
+static copies of JSON-LD contexts and/or verify the integrity of external
+contexts against a cryptographic hash that is known to be associated with a safe
+version of the external JSON-LD Context.
+9.16
+Persistence
+DIDs
+are designed to be persistent such that a
+controller
+need not
+rely upon a single trusted third party or administrator to maintain their
+identifiers. In an ideal case, no administrator can take control away from the
+controller
+, nor can an administrator prevent their identifiers' use for
+any particular purpose such as authentication, authorization, and attestation.
+No third party can act on behalf of a
+controller
+to remove or render
+inoperable an entity's identifier without the
+controller
+'s consent.
+However, it is important to note that in all
+DID methods
+that enable
+cryptographic proof-of-control, the means of proving control can always be
+transferred to another party by transferring the secret cryptographic material.
+Therefore, it is vital that systems relying on the persistence of an identifier
+over time regularly check to ensure that the identifier is, in fact, still under
+the control of the intended party.
+Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine from the cryptography alone whether
+or not the secret cryptographic material associated with a given
+verification method
+has been compromised. It might well be that the
+expected
+controller
+still has access to the secret cryptographic material
+— and as such can execute a proof-of-control as part of a verification
+process — while at the same time, a bad actor also has access to those
+same keys, or to a copy thereof.
+As such, cryptographic proof-of-control is expected to only be used as one
+factor in evaluating the level of identity assurance required for high-stakes
+scenarios.
+DID
+-based authentication provides much greater assurance than
+a username and password, thanks to the ability to determine control over a
+cryptographic secret without transmitting that secret between systems. However,
+it is not infallible. Scenarios that involve sensitive, high value, or
+life-critical operations are expected to use additional factors as appropriate.
+In addition to potential ambiguity from use by different
+controllers
+, it
+is impossible to guarantee, in general, that a given
+DID
+is being used in
+reference to the same subject at any given point in time. It is technically
+possible for the controller to reuse a
+DID
+for different subjects and,
+more subtly, for the precise definition of the subject to either change over
+time or be misunderstood.
+For example, consider a
+DID
+used for a sole proprietorship, receiving
+various credentials used for financial transactions. To the
+controller
+,
+that identifier referred to the business. As the business grows, it eventually
+gets incorporated as a Limited Liability Company. The
+controller
+continues using that same
+DID
+, because to
+them
+the
+DID
+refers to the business. However, to the state, the tax authority, and
+the local municipality, the
+DID
+no longer refers to the same entity.
+Whether or not the subtle shift in meaning matters to a credit provider or
+supplier is necessarily up to them to decide. In many cases, as long as the
+bills get paid and collections can be enforced, the shift is immaterial.
+Due to these potential ambiguities,
+DIDs
+are to be considered valid
+contextually
+rather than absolutely. Their persistence does not imply
+that they refer to the exact same subject, nor that they are under the control
+of the same
+controller
+. Instead, one needs to understand the context in
+which the
+DID
+was created, how it is used, and consider the likely shifts
+in their meaning, and adopt procedures and policies to address both potential
+and inevitable semantic drift.
+9.17
+Level of Assurance
+Additional information about the security context of authentication events is
+often required for compliance reasons, especially in regulated areas such as the
+financial and public sectors. This information is often referred to as a Level
+of Assurance (LOA). Examples include the protection of secret cryptographic
+material, the identity proofing process, and the form-factor of the
+authenticator.
+Payment services (PSD 2)
+and
+eIDAS
+introduce such requirements to the security context. Level of
+assurance frameworks are classified and defined by regulations and
+standards such as
+eIDAS
+,
+NIST 800-63-3
+and
+ISO/IEC
+29115:2013
+, including their requirements for the security context, and
+making recommendations on how to achieve them. This might include strong user
+authentication where
+FIDO2
+/
+WebAuthn
+can fulfill the
+requirement.
+Some regulated scenarios require the implementation of a specific level of
+assurance. Since
+verification relationships
+such as
+assertionMethod
+and
+authentication
+might be
+used in some of these situations, information about the applied security context
+might need to be expressed and provided to a
+verifier
+. Whether and how
+to encode this information in the
+DID document
+data model is out of scope
+for this specification. Interested readers might note that 1) the information
+could be transmitted using Verifiable Credentials [
+VC-DATA-MODEL
+], and 2) the
+DID document
+data model can be extended to incorporate this information
+as described in
+4.1
+Extensibility
+, and where
+10.
+Privacy Considerations
+is applicable for such extensions.
+10.
+Privacy Considerations
+This section is non-normative.
+Since
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+are designed to be administered
+directly by the
+DID controller(s)
+, it is critically important to apply
+the principles of Privacy by Design [
+PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN
+] to all aspects of the
+decentralized identifier
+architecture. All seven of these principles
+have been applied throughout the development of this specification. The design
+used in this specification does not assume that there is a registrar, hosting
+company, nor other intermediate service provider to recommend or apply
+additional privacy safeguards. Privacy in this specification is preventive,
+not remedial, and is an embedded default. The following sections cover privacy
+considerations that implementers might find useful when building systems that
+utilize
+decentralized identifiers
+.
+10.1
+Keep Personal Data Private
+If a
+DID method
+specification is written for a public-facing
+verifiable data registry
+where corresponding
+DIDs
+and
+DID
+documents
+might be made publicly available, it is
+critical
+that
+those
+DID documents
+contain no personal data. Personal data can instead
+be transmitted through other means such as 1) Verifiable Credentials
+[
+VC-DATA-MODEL
+], or 2)
+service endpoints
+under control of the
+DID
+subject
+or
+DID controller
+.
+Due diligence is expected to be taken around the use of URLs in
+service
+endpoints
+to prevent leakage of personal data or correlation within a URL of
+a
+service endpoint
+. For example, a URL that contains a username is
+dangerous to include in a
+DID Document
+because the username is likely to
+be human-meaningful in a way that can reveal information that the
+DID
+subject
+did not consent to sharing. With the privacy architecture suggested
+by this specification, personal data can be exchanged on a private, peer-to-peer
+basis using communication channels identified and secured by
+verification
+methods
+in
+DID documents
+. This also enables
+DID subjects
+and
+requesting parties to implement the
+GDPR
+right to be
+forgotten
+, because no personal data is written to an immutable
+distributed ledger
+.
+10.2
+DID Correlation Risks
+Like any type of globally unambiguous identifier,
+DIDs
+might be used for
+correlation.
+DID controllers
+can mitigate this privacy risk by using
+pairwise
+DIDs
+that are unique to each relationship; in effect, each
+DID
+acts as a pseudonym. A pairwise
+DID
+need only be shared with
+more than one party when correlation is explicitly desired. If pairwise
+DIDs
+are the default, then the only need to publish a
+DID
+openly,
+or to share it with multiple parties, is when the
+DID controller(s)
+and/or
+DID subject
+explicitly desires public identification and correlation.
+10.3
+DID Document Correlation Risks
+The anti-correlation protections of pairwise
+DIDs
+are easily defeated if
+the data in the corresponding
+DID documents
+can be correlated. For
+example, using identical
+verification methods
+or bespoke
+service
+endpoints
+in multiple
+DID documents
+can provide as much correlation
+information as using the same
+DID
+. Therefore, the
+DID document
+for
+a pairwise
+DID
+also needs to use pairwise unique information, such as
+ensuring that
+verification methods
+are unique to the pairwise
+relationship.
+It might seem natural to also use pairwise unique
+service endpoints
+in
+the
+DID document
+for a pairwise
+DID
+. However, unique endpoints
+allow all traffic between two
+DIDs
+to be isolated perfectly into unique
+buckets, where timing correlation and similar analysis is easy. Therefore, a
+better strategy for endpoint privacy might be to share an endpoint among a large
+number of
+DIDs
+controlled by many different subjects (see
+10.5
+Herd Privacy
+).
+10.4
+DID Subject Classification
+It is dangerous to add properties to the
+DID document
+that can be used
+to indicate, explicitly or through inference, what
+type
+or nature of
+thing the
+DID subject
+is, particularly if the
+DID subject
+is a
+person.
+Not only do such properties potentially result in personal data (see
+10.1
+Keep Personal Data Private
+) or
+correlatable data (see
+10.2
+DID Correlation Risks
+and
+10.3
+DID Document Correlation Risks
+) being present in the
+DID document
+, but they can be used for grouping particular
+DIDs
+in such a way that they are included in or excluded from certain operations or
+functionalities.
+Including
+type
+information in a
+DID Document
+can
+result in personal privacy harms even for
+DID Subjects
+that are
+non-person entities, such as IoT devices. The aggregation of such
+information around a
+DID Controller
+could serve as a form of
+digital fingerprint and this is best avoided.
+To minimize these risks, all properties in a
+DID document
+ought to be
+for expressing cryptographic material, endpoints, or
+verification methods
+related to using the
+DID
+.
+10.5
+Herd Privacy
+When a
+DID subject
+is indistinguishable from others in the herd,
+privacy is available. When the act of engaging privately with another party is
+by itself a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished.
+DIDs
+and
+DID
+methods
+need to work to improve herd privacy, particularly for those who
+legitimately need it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces that
+default to preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. To reduce
+digital
+fingerprints
+, share common settings across requesting party
+implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum on wire protocols, use
+encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to standard lengths.
+10.6
+Service Privacy
+The ability for a
+controller
+to optionally express at least one
+service endpoint
+in the
+DID document
+increases their control and
+agency. Each additional endpoint in the
+DID document
+adds privacy risk
+either due to correlation, such as across endpoint descriptions, or because the
+services
+are not protected by an authorization mechanism, or both.
+DID documents
+are often public and, since they are standardized, will be
+stored and indexed efficiently by their very standards-based nature. This risk
+is worse if
+DID documents
+are published to immutable
+verifiable data
+registries
+. Access to a history of the
+DID documents
+referenced by a
+DID
+represents a form of traffic analysis made more efficient through the
+use of standards.
+The degree of additional privacy risk caused by using multiple
+service
+endpoints
+in one
+DID document
+can be difficult to estimate. Privacy
+harms are typically unintended consequences.
+DIDs
+can refer to documents,
+services
+, schemas, and other things that might be associated with
+individual people, households, clubs, and employers — and correlation of
+their
+service endpoints
+could become a powerful surveillance and
+inference tool. An example of this potential harm can be seen when multiple
+common country-level top level domains such as
+https://example.co.uk
+might be used to infer the approximate
+location of the
+DID subject
+with a greater degree of probability.
+Maintaining Herd Privacy
+The variety of possible endpoints makes it particularly challenging to maintain
+herd privacy, in which no information about the
+DID subject
+is leaked
+(see
+10.5
+Herd Privacy
+).
+First, because service endpoints might be specified as
+URIs
+, they could
+unintentionally leak personal information because of the architecture of the
+service. For example, a service endpoint of
+http://example.com/MyFirstName
+is leaking the term
+MyFirstName
+to everyone who can access the
+DID document
+.
+When linking to legacy systems, this is an unavoidable risk, and care is
+expected to be taken in such cases. This specification encourages new,
+DID
+-aware endpoints to use nothing more than the
+DID
+itself for
+any identification necessary. For example, if a service description were to
+include
+http://example.com/did%3Aexample%3Aabc123
+, no harm would be
+done because
+did:example:abc123
+is already exposed in the DID
+Document; it leaks no additional information.
+Second, because a
+DID document
+can list multiple service endpoints, it is
+possible to irreversibly associate services that are not associated in any other
+context. This correlation on its own may lead to privacy harms by revealing
+information about the
+DID subject
+, even if the
+URIs
+used did not
+contain any sensitive information.
+Third, because some types of
+DID subjects
+might be more or less likely to
+list specific endpoints, the listing of a given service could, by itself, leak
+information that can be used to infer something about the
+DID subject
+.
+For example, a
+DID
+for an automobile might include a pointer to a public
+title record at the Department of Motor Vehicles, while a
+DID
+for an
+individual would not include that information.
+It is the goal of herd privacy to ensure that the nature of specific
+DID
+subjects
+is obscured by the population of the whole. To maximize herd
+privacy, implementers need to rely on one — and only one — service
+endpoint, with that endpoint providing a proxy or mediator service that the
+controller is willing to depend on, to protect such associations and to blind
+requests to the ultimate service.
+Service Endpoint Alternatives
+Given the concerns in the previous section, implementers are urged to
+consider any of the following service endpoint approaches:
+Negotiator Endpoint
+— Service for negotiating mutually
+agreeable communications channels, preferably using private set intersection.
+The output of negotiation is a communication channel and whatever credentials
+might be needed to access it.
+Tor Endpoint
+(
+Tor Onion Router
+) —
+Provide a privacy-respecting address for reaching service endpoints. Any service
+that can be provided online can be provided through TOR for additional
+privacy.
+Mediator Endpoint
+—
+Mediators
+provide a generic endpoint, for multiple parties, receive encrypted messages on
+behalf of those parties, and forward them to the intended recipient. This avoids
+the need to have a specific endpoint per subject, which could create a
+correlation risk. This approach is also called a proxy.
+Confidential Storage
+— Proprietary or confidential
+personal information might need to be kept off of a
+verifiable data
+registry
+to provide additional privacy and/or security guarantees,
+especially for those
+DID methods
+where
+DID documents
+are published
+on a public ledger. Pointing to external resource services provides a means for
+authorization checks and deletion.
+Polymorphic Proxy
+— A proxy endpoint that can act as any
+number of services, depending on how it is called. For example, the same URL
+could be used for both negotiator and mediator functions, depending on a
+mechanism for re-routing.
+These service endpoint types continue to be an area of innovation and
+exploration.

+7
+Detailed overview of DID architecture and the relationship of the basic components.
+B.2
+Creation of a DID
+The creation of a
+DID
+is a process that is defined by each
+DID
+Method
+. Some
+DID Methods
+, such as
+did:key
+, are purely
+generative, such that a
+DID
+and a
+DID document
+are generated by
+transforming a single piece of cryptographic material into a conformant
+representation
+. Other
+DID methods
+might require the use of a
+verifiable data registry
+, where the
+DID
+and
+DID document
+are recognized to exist by third parties only when the registration has been
+completed, as defined by the respective
+DID method
+. Other processes
+might be defined by the respective
+DID method
+.
+B.3
+Determining the DID subject
+A
+DID
+is a specific type of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), so a
+DID
+can refer to any resource. Per [
+RFC3986
+]:
+the term "resource" is used in a general sense for whatever might be
+identified by a URI. [...] A resource is not necessarily
+accessible via the Internet.
+Resources can be digital or physical, abstract or concrete. Any resource that
+can be assigned a URI can be assigned a
+DID
+. The resource referred to
+by the
+DID
+is the
+DID subject
+.
+The
+DID controller
+determines the
+DID subject
+.
+It is not expected to be possible to determine the
+DID subject
+from looking at the
+DID
+itself, as
+DIDs
+are generally
+only meaningful to machines, not human. A
+DID
+is unlikely to contain
+any information about the
+DID subject
+, so further information
+about the
+DID subject
+is only discoverable by resolving the
+DID
+to the
+DID document
+, obtaining a verifiable credential about the
+DID
+, or via some other description of the
+DID
+.
+While the value of the
+id
+property in the retrieved
+DID document
+must always match the
+DID
+being resolved, whether
+or not the actual resource to which the
+DID
+refers can change over time
+is dependent upon the
+DID method
+. For example, a
+DID method
+that permits the
+DID subject
+to change could be used to generate a
+DID
+for the current occupant of a particular role—such as the CEO
+of a company—where the actual person occupying the role can be different
+depending on when the
+DID
+is resolved.
+B.4
+Referring to the DID document
+The
+DID
+refers to the
+DID subject
+and
+resolves to
+the
+DID document
+(by following the protocol specified by the
+DID method
+). The
+DID document
+is not a separate resource from
+the
+DID subject
+and does not have a
+URI
+separate from the
+DID
+. Rather the
+DID document
+is an artifact of
+DID
+resolution
+controlled by the
+DID controller
+for the purpose of
+describing the
+DID subject
+.
+This distinction is illustrated by the graph model shown below.
+Figure
+8
+A
+DID
+is an identifier assigned by a
+DID controller
+to refer to
+a
+DID subject
+and resolve to a
+DID document
+that describes the
+DID subject
+. The
+DID document
+is an artifact of
+DID
+resolution
+and not a separate resource distinct from the
+DID subject
+.
+See also:
+narrative description
+.
+Two filled black circles appear at the top of the diagram, one on the left,
+labeled "DID Controller", and one on the right, labeled "DID Subject". A
+rectangle, with lower right corner bent inwards to form a small triangle,
+appears below, containing the label "DID Document". Arrows extend between these
+three items, as follows. A solid red arrow points directly from the DID
+Controller circle, rightwards to the DID Subject circle, labeled "DID" above it
+in large font, and "Identifies" below it in small italic font. The other arrow
+labels are also in small italic font. A dotted red arrow, labeled "Resolves
+to", extends from DID Controller, starting in the same line as the first arrow,
+then curving downward to point to the DID Document rectangle. A green arrow,
+labeled "Controls", points directly from DID Controller to DID Document. A
+green arrow labeled "Controller" points in the opposite direction, from DID
+Document to DID Controller, making an arc outward to the left of the diagram. A
+blue arrow, labeled, "Describes" points directly from DID Document to DID
+Subject.
+B.5
+Statements in the DID document
+Each property in a
+DID document
+is a statement by the
+DID controller
+that describes:
+The string of characters defining identifiers for the
+DID subject
+(e.g., the
+id
+and
+alsoKnownAs
+properties)
+How to interact with the
+DID subject
+(e.g., the
+verificationMethod
+and
+service
+properties).
+How to interpret the specific representation of the
+DID document
+(e.g., the
+@context
+property for a JSON-LD representation).
+The only required property in a
+DID document
+is
+id
+,
+so that is the only statement guaranteed to be in a
+DID document
+.
+That statement is illustrated in
+Figure
+8
+with a direct link between the
+DID
+and the
+DID subject
+.
+B.6
+Discovering more information about the DID subject
+Options for discovering more information about the
+DID subject
+depend
+on the properties present in the
+DID document
+. If the
+service
+property is present, more information can be
+requested from a
+service endpoint
+. For example, by querying a
+service endpoint
+that supports verifiable credentials for one or more
+claims (attributes) describing the
+DID subject
+.
+Another option is to use the
+alsoKnownAs
+property if it
+is present in the
+DID document
+. The
+DID controller
+can use it
+to provide a list of other URIs (including other
+DIDs
+) that refer to
+the same
+DID subject
+. Resolving or dereferencing these URIs might yield
+other descriptions or representations of the
+DID subject
+as
+illustrated in the figure below.
+Figure
+9
+A
+DID document
+can use the alsoKnownAs property to assert that another
+URI
+(including, but not necessarily, another
+DID
+) refers to the
+same
+DID subject
+. See also:

+.
+The diagram contains three small black filled circles, two rectangles with bent
+corners, arrows between them, and labels, as follows. On the upper left is a
+circle labeled "DID Controller". On the upper right is a circle labeled "DID
+Subject". On the lower-middle right is a circle without a label. On the lower
+right is a rectangle labeled "Description". In the center of the diagram is a
+rectangle labeled "DID Document". Inside the DID Document rectangle, beneath
+its label, is two lines of code: "alsoKnownAs: [", and "URI]". A black arrow
+extends from the second line, to the right, crossing the rectangle border,
+pointing to the unlabeled circle at the right of the diagram. This arrow is
+labeled above it in large font, "URI", and below it in italic, "Identifies". A
+black arrow points from the unlabeled circle downwards to the Description
+rectangle, labeled "Dereferences to". A blue arrow, labeled "Describes",
+extends from Description, arcing on the right, pointing up to DID Subject. A
+blue arrow, also labeled "Describes", points directly from the rectangle,
+labeled "DID Document", in the center of the diagram, up and to the right to the
+DID Subject circle. A red arrow, labeled "alsoKnownAs", points from DID Subject
+down to the unlabeled circle. A red arrow, labeled "DID" above it in large font,
+and "Identifies" below it in italic font, lies at the top of the image, pointing
+from DID Controller to DID Subject. A dotted red line starts in the same place
+but branches off and curves downward to point to the DID Document rectangle at
+the center of the image. A green arrow, labeled "Controls", points directly
+from DID Controller to DID Document. Another green arrow points in the opposite
+direction, labeled "Controller", curving outwards on the left of the image,
+from DID Document to DID Controller.
+B.7
+Serving a representation of the DID subject
+If the
+DID subject
+is a digital resource that can be retrieved
+from the internet, a
+DID method
+can choose to construct a
+DID URL
+which returns a representation of the
+DID subject
+itself. For example,
+a data schema that needs a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier
+could be assigned a
+DID
+, and passing a specified DID parameter (see
+3.2.1
+DID Parameters
+) could be used as a standard way to retrieve a
+representation of that schema.
+Similarly, a
+DID
+can be used to refer to a digital resource (such as
+an image) that can be returned directly from a
+verifiable data registry
+if that functionality is supported by the applicable
+DID method
+.
+B.8
+Assigning DIDs to existing web resources
+If the controller of a web page or any other web resource wants to
+assign it a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier, the
+controller can give it a
+DID
+. For example, the author of a blog
+hosted by a blog hosting company (under that hosting company's domain)
+could create a
+DID
+for the blog. In the
+DID document
+, the
+author can include the
+alsoKnownAs
+property pointing to
+the current URL of the blog, e.g.:
+"alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.blogging-host.example/home"]
+If the author subsequently moves the blog to a different hosting company
+(or to the author's own domain), the author can update the
+DID document
+to point to the new URL for the blog, e.g.:
+"alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.example/"]
+The
+DID
+effectively adds a layer of indirection for the blog URL. This
+layer of indirection is under the control of the author instead of under the
+control of an external administrative authority such as the blog hosting
+company. This is how a
+DID
+can effectively function as an enhanced
+URN (Uniform Resource
+Name)
+—a persistent identifier for an information resource whose
+network location might change over time.
+B.9
+The relationship between DID controllers and DID subjects
+To avoid confusion, it is helpful to classify
+DID subject
+s into two disjoint sets based on their relationship to
+the
+DID controller
+.
+B.9.1
+Set #1: The DID subject
+is
+the DID controller
+The first case, shown in
+Figure
+10
+, is
+the common scenario where the
+DID subject
+is also the
+DID
+controller
+. This is the case when an individual or organization creates a
+DID
+to self-identify.
+Figure
+10
+The
+DID subject
+is the same entity as the
+DID controller
+. See
+also:
+narrative description
+.
+Two small black circles appear in the diagram, one on the upper left, labeled,
+"DID Controller", and one on the upper right, labeled "DID Subject". A solid red
+arrow extends from the DID Controller circle to the DID Subject circle, labeled
+"DID" in large bold text above the arrow, and "Identifies" in small italic text
+beneath the arrow. A dotted red double-ended arrow, labeled "Equivalence",
+extends between the two circles, forming an arc in the space between and above
+them. In the lower part of the diagram is a rectangle with bent corner, outlined
+in black, containing the label "DID Document". Arrows point between this DID
+Document rectangle and the small black circles for DID Controller and DID
+Subject, with italic labels, as follows. A blue arrow points from the DID
+Document to the DID Subject, labeled, "Describes". A green arrow points from the
+DID Controller to the DID Document, labeled "Controls". A green arrow points
+from the DID Document to the DID Controller, in an outward arc, labeled,
+"Controller". A dotted red arrow, labeled "Resolves to", extends from the DID
+controller starting to the right, branching off from the arrow to the DID
+Subject, then curving downward to point to the DID Document.
+From a graph model perspective, even though the nodes identified as the
+DID controller
+and
+DID subject
+in
+Figure
+10
+are distinct, there is a
+logical arc connecting them to express a semantic equivalence relationship.
+B.9.2
+Set #2: The DID subject is
+not
+the DID controller
+The second case is when the
+DID subject
+is a separate entity from the
+DID controller
+. This is the case when, for example, a parent creates
+and maintains control of a
+DID
+for a child; a corporation creates and
+maintains control of a
+DID
+for a subsidiary; or a manufacturer
+creates and maintains control of a
+DID
+for a product, an IoT device,
+or a digital file.
+From a graph model perspective, the only difference from Set 1 that there is
+no equivalence arc relationship between the
+DID subject
+and
+DID controller
+nodes.
+B.10
+Multiple DID controllers
+A
+DID document
+might have more than one
+DID controller
+. This can
+happen in one of two ways.
+B.10.1
+Independent Control
+In this case, each of the
+DID controllers
+might act on its own, i.e.,
+each one has full power to update the
+DID document
+independently. From
+a graph model perspective, in this configuration:
+Each additional
+DID controller
+is another distinct graph node
+(which might be identified by its own
+DID
+).
+The same arcs ("controls" and "controller") exist between each
+DID controller
+and the
+DID document
+.
+Figure
+11
+Multiple independent
+DID controllers
+that can each act independently. See
+also:
+Text
+Description
+Three black circles appear on the left, vertically, each labeled "DID
+Controller". From each of these circles, a pair of green arrows extends towards
+the center of the diagram, to a single rectangle, labeled "DID Document". The
+rectangle has the lower right corner cut and bent inward to form a small
+triangle, as if to represent a physical piece of paper with curled corner. Each
+pair of green arrows consists of one arrow pointing from the black circle to the
+rectangle, labeled "Controls", and one pointing in the opposite direction, from
+the rectangle to the black circle, labeled "Controller". From the right of the
+rectangle extends a blue arrow, labeled, "Describes", pointing to a black circle
+labeled, "DID Subject".
+B.10.2
+Group Control
+In the case of group control, the
+DID controllers
+are expected to act
+together in some fashion, such as when using a cryptographic algorithm that
+requires multiple digital signatures ("multi-sig") or a threshold number of
+digital signatures ("m-of-n"). From a functional standpoint, this option is
+similar to a single
+DID controller
+because, although each of the
+DID controllers
+in the
+DID controller
+group has its own graph
+node, the actual control collapses into a single logical graph node
+representing the
+DID controller
+group as shown in
+Figure
+12
+.
+Figure
+12
+Multiple
+DID controllers
+who are expected to act together as a
+DID
+controller
+group. See also:
+narrative description
+.
+On the left are three black filled circles, labeled "DID Controller Group" by a
+brace on the left. From each of these three circles, a green arrow extends to
+the center right. These three arrows converge towards a single filled white
+circle. A pair of horizontal green arrows connects this white circle on its
+right to a rectangle shaped like a page with a curled corner, labeled "DID
+Document". The upper arrow points right, from the white circle to the
+rectangle, and is labeled "Controls". The lower arrow points left, from the
+rectangle to the white circle, and is labeled "Controller". From the right of
+the rectangle extends a blue arrow, labeled "Describes", pointing to a black
+circle, labeled "DID Subject".
+This configuration will often apply when the
+DID subject
+is an
+organization, corporation, government agency, community, or other group
+that is not controlled by a single individual.
+B.11
+Changing the DID subject
+A
+DID document
+has exactly one
+DID
+which refers to
+the
+DID subject
+. The
+DID
+is expressed as the value of the
+id
+property. This property value is immutable for
+the lifetime of the
+DID document
+.
+However, it is possible that the resource
+identified
+by the
+DID
+,
+the
+DID subject
+, may change over time. This is under the exclusive
+authority of the
+DID controller
+. For more details, see section
+9.16
+Persistence
+.
+B.12
+Changing the DID controller
+The
+DID controller
+for a
+DID document
+might change over time.
+However, depending on how it is implemented, a change in the
+DID
+controller
+might not be made apparent by changes to the
+DID document
+itself. For example, if the change is implemented through a shift in ownership
+of the underlying cryptographic keys or other controls used for one or more of
+the
+verification methods
+in the
+DID document
+, it might be
+indistinguishable from a standard key rotation.
+On the other hand, if the change is implemented by changing the value of the
+controller
+property, it will be transparent.
+If it is important to verify a change of
+DID controller
+, implementers are
+advised to
+authenticate
+the new
+DID controller
+against the
+verification methods
+in the revised
+DID document
+.

+Acknowledgements
+The Working Group extends deep appreciation and heartfelt thanks to our Chairs
+Brent Zundel and Dan Burnett, as well as our
+W3C
+Staff Contact, Ivan Herman, for
+their tireless work in keeping the Working Group headed in a productive
+direction and navigating the deep and dangerous waters of the standards process.
+The Working Group gratefully acknowledges the work that led to the creation of
+this specification, and extends sincere appreciation to those individuals that
+worked on technologies and specifications that deeply influenced our work. In
+particular, this includes the work of Phil Zimmerman, Jon Callas, Lutz
+Donnerhacke, Hal Finney, David Shaw, and Rodney Thayer on
+Pretty Good Privacy
+(PGP)
+in the 1990s and 2000s.
+In the mid-2010s, preliminary implementations of what would become Decentralized
+Identifiers were
+built
+in collaboration with Jeremie Miller's Telehash project and the
+W3C
+Web Payments Community Group's work led by Dave Longley and Manu Sporny. Around
+a year later, the XDI.org Registry Working Group
+began exploring
+decentralized technologies for replacing its existing
+identifier registry. Some of the first
+written
+papers
+exploring the concept of Decentralized Identifiers can be traced back to the
+first several Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops convened by Christopher
+Allen. That work led to a key collaboration between Christopher Allen, Drummond
+Reed, Les Chasen, Manu Sporny, and Anil John. Anil saw promise in the technology
+and allocated the initial set of government funding to explore the space.
+Without the support of Anil John and his guidance through the years, it is
+unlikely that Decentralized Identifiers would be where they are today. Further
+refinement at the Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops led to the
+first
+implementers documentation
+, edited by Drummond Reed, Les Chasen, Christopher
+Allen, and Ryan Grant. Contributors included Manu Sporny, Dave Longley, Jason
+Law, Daniel Hardman, Markus Sabadello, Christian Lundkvist, and Jonathan
+Endersby. This initial work was then merged into the
+W3C
+Credentials Community
+Group, incubated further, and then transitioned to the
+W3C
+Decentralized
+Identifiers Working Group for global standardization.
