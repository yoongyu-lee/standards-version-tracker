+Abstract
+This document specifies mechanism for use of certification on trustworthiness of secure area that is defined in ISO/IEC 23220-1.
+This document aims at enabling secure area providers to describe capabilities and confidence level of secure area for verification by eID issuers or mobile eID Attestation service providers, or both.
+This document specifies:
+—
+list of elements describing capabilities and confidence level of a secure area;
+—
+structure and management for use of a certificate, affixed or not to the secure area, containing that list of elements.
+This document refers to existing standards and applicable industry specifications which partly address the trustworthiness related issue (e.g. DLOA specified in GlobalPlatform specification GPC_SPE_095
+[
+1
+]
+, MDS specified in FIDO Alliance specification
+[
+2
+]
+, and SAAO specified in ISO/IEC TS 23220-3), and aims to minimize the differences between them.
