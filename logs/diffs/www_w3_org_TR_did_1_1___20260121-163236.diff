+Abstract
+Decentralized identifiers
+(DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
+enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A
+DID
+refers to any
+subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)
+as determined by the controller of the
+DID
+. In contrast to
+typical, federated identifiers,
+DIDs
+have been designed so that they may
+be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate
+authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the
+discovery of information related to a
+DID
+, the design enables the
+controller of a
+DID
+to prove control over it without requiring permission
+from any other party.
+DIDs
+are
+URIs
+that associate a
+DID subject
+with a
+DID document
+allowing trustable interactions
+associated with that subject.
+Each
+DID document
+can express cryptographic material,
+verification methods
+, or
+services
+, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a
+DID controller
+to prove control of the
+DID
+.
+Services
+enable
+trusted interactions associated with the
+DID subject
+. A
+DID
+might
+provide the means to return the
+DID subject
+itself, if the
+DID subject
+is an information resource such as a data model.
+This document specifies the DID syntax, a common data model, core properties,
+serialized representations, DID operations, and an explanation of the process
+of resolving DIDs to the resources that they represent.

+Introduction
+This section is non-normative.
+As individuals and organizations, many of us use globally unique identifiers in
+a wide variety of contexts. They serve as communications addresses (telephone
+numbers, email addresses, usernames on social media), ID numbers (for passports,
+drivers licenses, tax IDs, health insurance), and product identifiers (serial
+numbers, barcodes, RFIDs). URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) are used for
+resources on the Web and each web page you view in a browser has a globally
+unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
+The vast majority of these globally unique identifiers are not under our
+control. They are issued by external authorities that decide who or what they
+refer to and when they can be revoked. They are useful only in certain contexts
+and recognized only by certain bodies not of our choosing. They might
+disappear or cease to be valid with the failure of an organization. They might
+unnecessarily reveal personal information. In many cases, they can be
+fraudulently replicated and asserted by a malicious third-party, which is
+more commonly known as "identity theft".
+The Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) defined in this specification are a new
+type of globally unique identifier. They are designed to enable individuals and
+organizations to generate their own identifiers using systems they trust. These
+new identifiers enable entities to prove control over them by authenticating
+using cryptographic proofs such as digital signatures.
+Since the generation and assertion of Decentralized Identifiers is
+entity-controlled, each entity can have as many DIDs as necessary to maintain
+their desired separation of identities, personas, and interactions. The use of
+these identifiers can be scoped appropriately to different contexts. They
+support interactions with other people, institutions, or systems that require
+entities to identify themselves, or things they control, while providing control
+over how much personal or private data should be revealed, all without depending
+on a central authority to guarantee the continued existence of the identifier.
+These ideas are explored in the DID Use Cases document [
+DID-USE-CASES
+].
+This specification does not presuppose any particular technology or cryptography
+to underpin the generation, persistence, resolution, or interpretation of DIDs.
+For example, implementers can create Decentralized Identifiers based on
+identifiers registered in federated or centralized identity management systems.
+Indeed, almost all types of identifier systems can add support for DIDs. This
+creates an interoperability bridge between the worlds of centralized, federated,
+and decentralized identifiers. This also enables implementers to design specific
+types of DIDs to work with the computing infrastructure they trust, such as
+distributed ledgers, decentralized file systems, distributed databases, and
+peer-to-peer networks.
+This specification is for:
+Anyone that wants to understand the core architectural principles that
+are the foundation for Decentralized Identifiers;
+Software developers that want to produce and consume Decentralized Identifiers
+and their associated data formats;
+Systems integrators that want to understand how to use Decentralized
+Identifiers in their software and hardware systems;
+Specification authors that want to create new DID infrastructures, known as DID
+methods, that conform to the ecosystem described by this document.
+In addition to this specification, readers might find the
+Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers [
+DID-USE-CASES
+]
+document useful.
+1.1
+A Simple Example
+This section is non-normative.
+A
+DID
+is a simple text string consisting of three parts: 1) the
+did
+URI scheme identifier, 2) the identifier for the
+DID method
+, and 3) the DID method-specific identifier.
+Figure
+1
+A simple example of a decentralized identifier (DID)
+The example
+DID
+above resolves to a
+DID document
+. A
+DID document
+contains information associated with the
+DID
+, such as ways
+to cryptographically
+authenticate
+a
+DID controller
+.
+Example
+1
+: A simple DID document
+{
+"@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1.1",
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"authentication": [{
+// used to authenticate as did:...fghi
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
+"type": "Multikey",
+"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"publicKeyMultibase": "z6MkmM42vxfqZQsv4ehtTjFFxQ4sQKS2w6WR7emozFAn5cxu"
+}]
+}
+1.2
+Design Goals
+This section is non-normative.
+Decentralized Identifiers
+are a component of larger systems, such as the
+Verifiable Credentials ecosystem [
+VC-DATA-MODEL
+], which influenced the design
+goals for this specification. The design goals for Decentralized Identifiers
+are summarized here.
+Goal
+Description
+Decentralization
+Eliminate the requirement for centralized authorities or single points of
+failure in identifier management, including the registration of globally unique
+identifiers, public verification keys,
+services
+, and other information.
+Control
+Give entities, both human and non-human, the power to directly control their
+digital identifiers without the need to rely on external authorities.
+Privacy
+Enable entities to control the privacy of their information, including minimal,
+selective, and progressive disclosure of attributes or other data.
+Security
+Enable sufficient security for requesting parties to depend on
+DID documents
+for their required level of assurance.
+Proof-based
+Enable
+DID controllers
+to provide cryptographic proof when interacting
+with other entities.
+Discoverability
+Make it possible for entities to discover
+DIDs
+for other entities, to
+learn more about or interact with those entities.
+Interoperability
+Use interoperable standards so
+DID
+infrastructure can make use of
+existing tools and software libraries designed for interoperability.
+Portability
+Be system- and network-independent and enable entities to use their digital
+identifiers with any system that supports
+DIDs
+and
+DID methods
+.
+Simplicity
+Favor a reduced set of simple features to make the technology easier to
+understand, implement, and deploy.
+Extensibility
+Where possible, enable extensibility provided it does not greatly hinder
+interoperability, portability, or simplicity.
+1.3
+Architecture Overview
+This section is non-normative.
+This section provides a basic overview of the major components of
+Decentralized Identifier architecture.

+Six internally-labeled shapes appear in the diagram, with labeled arrows
+between them, as follows. In the center of the diagram is a rectangle labeled
+DID URL, containing small typewritten text "did:example:123/path/to/rsrc". At
+the center top of the diagram is a rectangle labeled, "DID", containing small
+typewritten text "did:example:123". At the top left of the diagram is an oval,
+labeled "DID Subject". At the bottom center of the diagram is a rectangle
+labeled, "DID document". At the bottom left is an oval, labeled, "DID
+Controller". On the center right of the diagram is a two-dimensional rendering
+of a cylinder, labeled, "Verifiable Data Registry".
+From the top of the "DID URL" rectangle, an arrow, labeled "contains", extends
+upwards, pointing to the "DID" rectangle. From the bottom of the "DID URL"
+rectangle, an arrow, labeled "refers, and
+dereferences
+, to", extends downward, pointing to the
+"DID document" rectangle. An arrow from the "DID" rectangle, labeled
+"
+resolves
+to", points down to the "DID document"
+rectangle. An arrow from the "DID" rectangle, labeled "refers to", points left
+to the "DID subject" oval. An arrow from the "DID controller" oval, labeled
+"controls", points right to the "DID document" rectangle. An arrow from the
+"DID" rectangle, labeled "recorded on", points downards to the right, to the
+"Verifiable Data Registry" cylinder. An arrow from the "DID document" rectangle,
+labeled "recorded on", points upwards to the right to the "Verifiable Data
+Registry" cylinder.
+DIDs and DID URLs
+A Decentralized Identifier, or
+DID
+, is a
+URI
+composed of three
+parts: the scheme
+did:
+, a method identifier, and a unique,
+method-specific identifier specified by the
+DID method
+.
+DIDs
+are
+resolvable to
+DID documents
+. A
+DID URL
+extends the syntax of a
+basic
+DID
+to incorporate other standard
+URI
+components such as
+path, query, and fragment in order to locate a particular
+resource
+—for example, a cryptographic public key inside a
+DID document
+, or a
+resource
+external to the
+DID document
+.
+These concepts are elaborated upon in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+and
+3.2
+DID URL Syntax
+.
+DID subjects
+The subject of a
+DID
+is, by definition, the entity identified by the
+DID
+. The
+DID subject
+might also be the
+DID controller
+.
+Anything can be the subject of a
+DID
+: person, group, organization,
+thing, or concept. This is further defined in
+5.1.1
+DID Subject
+.
+DID controllers
+The
+controller
+of a
+DID
+is the entity (person, organization, or
+autonomous software) that has the capability—as defined by a
+DID method
+—to make changes to a
+DID document
+. This capability is
+typically asserted by the control of a set of cryptographic keys used by
+software acting on behalf of the controller, though it might also be asserted
+via other mechanisms. Note that a
+DID
+might have more than one
+controller, and the
+DID subject
+can be the
+DID controller
+, or one
+of them. This concept is documented in
+5.1.2
+DID Controller
+.
+Verifiable data registries
+In order to be resolvable to
+DID documents
+,
+DIDs
+are typically
+recorded on an underlying system or network of some kind. Regardless of the
+specific technology used, any such system that supports recording
+DIDs
+and returning data necessary to produce
+DID documents
+is called a
+verifiable data registry
+. Examples include
+distributed ledgers
+,
+decentralized file systems, databases of any kind, peer-to-peer networks, and
+other forms of trusted data storage. This concept is further elaborated upon in
+7.
+Methods
+.
+DID documents
+DID documents
+contain information associated with a
+DID
+. They
+typically express
+verification methods
+, such as cryptographic public
+keys, and
+services
+relevant to interactions with the
+DID subject
+.
+The generic properties supported in a
+DID document
+are specified in
+5.
+Core Properties
+. A
+DID document
+can be serialized to a byte
+stream (see
+6.
+Representations
+). The properties present in
+a
+DID document
+can be updated according to the applicable operations
+outlined in
+7.
+Methods
+.
+DID methods
+DID methods
+are the mechanism by which a particular type of
+DID
+and its associated
+DID document
+are created, resolved, updated, and
+deactivated.
+DID methods
+are defined using separate DID method
+specifications as defined in
+7.
+Methods
+.
+DID resolvers and DID resolution
+A
+DID resolver
+is a system component that takes a
+DID
+as input and
+produces a conforming
+DID document
+as output. This process is called
+DID resolution
+. The steps for resolving a specific type of
+DID
+are
+defined by the relevant
+DID method
+specification. The process of
+DID resolution
+is elaborated upon in [
+DID-RESOLUTION
+].
+DID URL dereferencers and DID URL dereferencing
+A
+DID URL dereferencer
+is a system component that takes a
+DID URL
+as input and produces a
+resource
+as output. This process is
+called
+DID URL dereferencing
+. The process of
+DID URL dereferencing
+is elaborated upon in [
+DID-RESOLUTION
+].
+1.4
+Conformance
+As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.
+The key words
+MAY
+,
+MUST
+,
+MUST NOT
+,
+RECOMMENDED
+,
+SHOULD
+, and
+SHOULD NOT
+in this document
+are to be interpreted as described in
+BCP 14
+[
+RFC2119
+] [
+RFC8174
+]
+when, and only when, they appear in all
+capitals, as shown here.
+This document contains examples that contain JSON and JSON-LD content.
+Some of these examples contain characters that are invalid, such as inline
+comments (
+//
+) and the use of ellipsis (
+...
+) to denote
+information that adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to
+remove this content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON
+or JSON-LD.
+Some examples contain terms, both property names and values, that are not
+defined in this specification. These are indicated with a comment (
+//
+external (property name|value)
+). Such terms, when used in a
+DID document
+, are expected to be registered in the repository of DID Extensions
+[
+DID-EXTENSIONS
+] with links to both a formal definition and a JSON-LD
+context.
+Interoperability of implementations for
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+is
+tested by evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+that conform to this specification. Interoperability
+for producers and consumers of
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+is provided
+by ensuring the
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+conform. Interoperability
+for
+DID method
+specifications is provided by the details in each
+DID method
+specification. It is understood that, in the same way that a web
+browser is not required to implement all known
+URI
+schemes, conformant
+software that works with
+DIDs
+is not required to implement all known
+DID methods
+. However, all implementations of a given
+DID method
+are expected to be interoperable for that method.
+A
+conforming DID
+is any concrete expression of the rules specified in

+A
+conforming DID document
+is any concrete expression
+of the data model described in this specification which complies with the

+1.5
+Audience
+This section is non-normative.
+This specification has two primary audiences: implementers of conformant DID methods; and implementers of systems and services that wish to interact and interface with DIDs. The intended audience includes, but is not limited to, software architects, data modelers, application developers, service developers, testers, operators, and user experience (UX) specialists. Other people involved in a broad range of standards efforts related to decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, and secure storage might also be interested in reading this specification.
+2.
+Terminology
+This section is non-normative.
+This section defines the terms used in this specification and throughout
+decentralized identifier
+infrastructure. A link to these terms is
+included whenever they appear in this specification.
+amplification attack
+A class of attack where the attacker attempts to exhaust a target system's
+CPU, storage, network, or other resources by providing small, valid inputs into
+the system that result in damaging effects that can be exponentially more costly
+to process than the inputs themselves.
+decentralized identifier
+(DID)
+A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized
+registration authority and is often generated and/or registered
+cryptographically. The generic format of a DID is defined in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. A specific
+DID scheme
+is defined in a
+DID
+method
+specification. Many—but not all—DID methods make use of
+distributed ledger technology
+(DLT) or some other form of decentralized
+network.
+DID controller
+An entity that has the capability to make changes to a
+DID document
+. A
+DID
+might have more than one DID controller. The DID controller(s)
+can be denoted by the optional
+controller
+property at the top level of the
+DID document
+. Note that a DID controller might be the
+DID
+subject
+.
+DID delegate
+An entity to whom a
+DID controller
+has granted permission to use a
+verification method
+associated with a
+DID
+via a
+DID document
+. For
+example, a parent who controls a child's
+DID document
+might permit the child
+to use their personal device in order to
+authenticate
+. In
+this case, the child is the
+DID delegate
+. The child's personal device would
+contain the private cryptographic material enabling the child to
+authenticate
+using the
+DID
+. However, the child might not
+be permitted to add other personal devices without the parent's permission.
+DID document
+A set of data describing the
+DID subject
+, including mechanisms, such as
+cryptographic public keys, that the
+DID subject
+or a
+DID delegate
+can
+use to
+authenticate
+itself and prove its association with the
+DID
+. A DID document might have one or more different
+representations
+as
+defined in
+6.
+Representations
+or in the
+W3C
+Decentralized Identifier Extensions
+.
+DID fragment
+The portion of a
+DID URL
+that follows the first hash sign character
+(
+#
+). DID fragment syntax is identical to URI fragment syntax.
+DID method
+A definition of how a specific
+DID method scheme
+is implemented. A DID method is
+defined by a DID method specification, which specifies the precise operations by
+which
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+are created, resolved, updated,
+and deactivated. See
+7.
+Methods
+.
+DID path
+The portion of a
+DID URL
+that begins with and includes the first forward
+slash (
+/
+) character and ends with either a question mark
+(
+?
+) character, a fragment hash sign (
+#
+) character,
+or the end of the
+DID URL
+. DID path syntax is identical to URI path syntax.
+See
+Path
+.
+DID query
+The portion of a
+DID URL
+that follows and includes the first question
+mark character (
+?
+). DID query syntax is identical to URI query
+syntax. See
+Query
+.
+DID resolution
+The process that takes as its input a
+DID
+and a set of resolution
+options and returns a
+DID document
+in a conforming
+representation
+plus additional metadata. This process relies on the "Read" operation of the
+applicable
+DID method
+. The inputs and outputs of this process are
+defined in [
+DID-RESOLUTION
+].
+DID resolver
+A
+DID resolver
+is a software and/or hardware component that performs the
+DID resolution
+function by taking a
+DID
+as input and producing a
+conforming
+DID document
+as output.
+DID scheme
+The formal syntax of a
+decentralized identifier
+. The generic DID scheme
+begins with the prefix
+did:
+as defined in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. Each
+DID method
+specification defines a specific
+DID method scheme that works with that specific
+DID method
+. In a specific DID
+method scheme, the DID method name follows the first colon and terminates with
+the second colon, e.g.,
+did:example:
+DID subject
+The entity identified by a
+DID
+and described by a
+DID document
+.
+Anything can be a DID subject: person, group, organization, physical thing,
+digital thing, logical thing, etc.
+DID URL
+A
+DID
+plus any additional syntactic component that conforms to the
+definition in
+3.2
+DID URL Syntax
+. This includes an optional
+DID
+path
+(with its leading
+/
+character), optional
+DID query
+(with its leading
+?
+character), and optional
+DID fragment
+(with its leading
+#
+character).
+DID URL dereferencing
+The process that takes as its input a
+DID URL
+and a set of input
+metadata, and returns a
+resource
+. This resource might be a
+DID
+document
+plus additional metadata, a secondary resource
+contained within the
+DID document
+, or a resource entirely
+external to the
+DID document
+. The process uses
+DID resolution
+to
+fetch a
+DID document
+indicated by the
+DID
+contained within the
+DID URL
+. The dereferencing process can then perform additional processing
+on the
+DID document
+to return the dereferenced resource indicated by the
+DID URL
+. The inputs and outputs of this process are defined in
+[
+DID-RESOLUTION
+].
+DID URL dereferencer
+A software and/or hardware system that performs the
+DID URL dereferencing
+function for a given
+DID URL
+or
+DID document
+.
+distributed ledger
+(DLT)
+A non-centralized system for recording events. These systems establish
+sufficient confidence for participants to rely upon the data recorded by others
+to make operational decisions. They typically use distributed databases where
+different nodes use a consensus protocol to confirm the ordering of
+cryptographically signed transactions. The linking of digitally signed
+transactions over time often makes the history of the ledger effectively
+immutable.
+resource
+A thing that is identified by a
+URI
+, as defined in [
+RFC3986
+]. Similarly,
+any resource might serve as a
+DID subject
+identified by a
+DID
+.
+representation
+A concrete expression of a
+resource
+, as defined by [
+RFC9110
+]: "information
+that is intended to reflect a past, current, or desired state of a given
+resource, in a format that can be readily communicated via the protocol. A
+representation consists of a set of representation metadata and a potentially unbounded
+stream of representation data." A
+DID document
+is a representation of
+information describing a
+DID subject
+. See
+6.
+Representations
+.
+representation-specific entries
+Entries in a
+DID document
+whose meaning is particular to a specific
+representation
+. Defined in
+4.
+Data Model
+and
+6.
+Representations
+.
+service
+A means of communicating or interacting with the
+DID subject
+or
+associated entities via one or more
+service endpoints
+.
+Examples include discovery services, agent services, social networking
+services, file storage services, and verifiable credential repository services.
+did service endpoint
+A network address, such as an HTTP URL, at which
+services
+operate on
+behalf of a
+DID subject
+.
+Uniform Resource Identifier
+(URI)
+The standard identifier format for all resources on the World Wide Web as
+defined by [
+RFC3986
+]. A
+DID
+is a type of URI scheme.
+verifiable data registry
+A system that facilitates the creation, verification, updating, and/or
+deactivation of
+decentralized identifiers
+and
+DID documents
+. A
+verifiable data registry might also be used for other
+cryptographically-verifiable data structures such as
+verifiable credentials
+. For more information, see the
+W3C
+Verifiable Credentials
+specification [
+VC-DATA-MODEL
+].
+verifiable timestamp
+A verifiable timestamp enables a third-party to verify that a data object
+existed at a specific moment in time and that it has not been modified or
+corrupted since that moment in time. If the data integrity could reasonably have
+been modified or corrupted since that moment in time, the timestamp is not
+verifiable.
+In addition to the terminology above, this specification also uses terminology
+from the [
+INFRA
+] specification to formally define the
+data model
+. When [
+INFRA
+] terminology is used, such as
+string
+,
+set
+, and
+map
+, it is linked directly to that specification.
+3.
+Identifier
+This section describes the formal syntax for
+DIDs
+and
+DID URLs
+.
+The term "generic" is used to differentiate the syntax defined here from syntax
+defined by
+specific
+DID methods
+in their respective
+specifications. The creation processes, and their timing, for
+DIDs
+and
+DID URLs
+are described in
+7.2
+Method Operations
+and
+B.2
+Creation of a DID
+.
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+The generic
+DID scheme
+is a
+URI
+scheme conformant with
+[
+RFC3986
+]. The ABNF definition can be found below, which uses the syntax in
+[
+RFC5234
+] and the corresponding definitions for
+ALPHA
+and
+DIGIT
+. All other rule names not defined in the ABNF below are
+defined in [
+RFC3986
+]. All
+DIDs
+MUST
+conform to the
+DID Syntax ABNF Rules.
+The DID Syntax ABNF Rules
+did                = "did:" method-name ":" method-specific-id
+method-name        = 1*method-char
+method-char        = %x61-7A / DIGIT
+method-specific-id = *( *idchar ":" ) 1*idchar
+idchar             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_" / pct-encoded
+pct-encoded        = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
+For requirements on
+DID methods
+relating to the
+DID
+syntax, see
+Section
+7.1
+Method Syntax
+.
+3.2
+DID URL Syntax
+A
+DID URL
+is a network location identifier for a specific
+resource
+. It can be used to retrieve things like representations
+of
+DID subjects
+,
+verification methods
+,
+services
+,
+specific parts of a
+DID document
+, or other resources.
+The following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [
+RFC5234
+]. It builds
+on the
+did
+scheme defined in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. The
+path-abempty
+,
+query
+, and
+fragment
+components are
+defined in [
+RFC3986
+]. All
+DID URLs
+MUST
+conform to the
+DID URL Syntax ABNF Rules.
+DID methods
+can further restrict these
+rules, as described in
+7.1
+Method Syntax
+.
+The DID URL Syntax ABNF Rules
+did-url = did path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
+Note
+: Semicolon character is reserved for future use
+Although the semicolon (
+;
+) character can be used according to the
+rules of the
+DID URL
+syntax, future versions of this specification may
+use it as a sub-delimiter for parameters as described in [
+MATRIX-URIS
+]. To
+avoid future conflicts, developers ought to refrain from using it.
+Path
+A
+DID path
+is identical to a generic
+URI
+path and conforms to the
+path-abempty
+ABNF rule in
+RFC 3986, section 3.3
+. As with
+URIs
+, path semantics can be specified by
+DID Methods
+, which in
+turn might enable
+DID controllers
+to further specialize those semantics.
+Example
+2
+did:example:123456/path
+Query
+A
+DID query
+is identical to a generic
+URI
+query and conforms to
+the
+query
+ABNF rule in
+RFC 3986, section 3.4
+.
+Example
+3
+did:example:123456?versionId=1
+Note
+: Avoid comparison of DID URLs containing
+multiple query parameters
+Implementers are urged to avoid comparing
+DID URLs
+for equivalence when
+they have more than one query parameter without a specification specifically
+designed for that purpose. This specification defines no normalization rules
+for query parameters, and any query parameter normalization rules defined at
+the DID Method specification or application layer are not universally
+recognized rules.
+Fragment
+DID fragment
+syntax and semantics are identical to a generic
+URI
+fragment and conforms to the
+fragment
+ABNF rule in
+RFC 3986, section 3.5
+.
+A
+DID fragment
+is used as a method-independent reference into a
+DID document
+or external
+resource
+. Some examples of DID fragment
+identifiers are shown below.
+Example
+4
+: A unique verification method in a DID Document
+did:example:123#public-key-1
+Example
+5
+: A unique service in a DID Document
+did:example:123#service-5
+Note
+: Fragment semantics across representations
+In order to maximize interoperability, implementers are urged to ensure that
+DID fragments
+are interpreted in the same way across
+representations
+(see
+6.
+Representations
+). For example, while
+JSON Pointer [
+RFC6901
+] can be used in a
+DID fragment
+, it will not be
+interpreted in the same way across non-JSON
+representations
+.
+Additional semantics for fragment identifiers, which are compatible with and
+layered upon the semantics in this section, are specified in the media type
+description (see Section
+E.1
+application/did
+). For information about how to
+dereference a
+DID fragment
+, see the
+Decentralized Identifier Resolution (DID Resolution) v0.3
+specification.
+3.2.1
+Relative DID URLs
+A relative
+DID URL
+is any URL value in a
+DID document
+that does
+not start with
+did:<method-name>:<method-specific-id>
+. More
+specifically, it is any URL value that does not start with the ABNF defined in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. The URL is expected to reference
+a
+resource
+in the same
+DID document
+. Relative
+DID URLs
+MAY
+contain relative path components, query parameters, and fragment identifiers.
+When resolving a relative
+DID URL
+reference, the algorithm specified in
+RFC3986 Section 5: Reference Resolution
+MUST
+be used. The
+base URI
+value is the
+DID
+that is
+associated with the
+DID subject
+, see
+5.1.1
+DID Subject
+. The
+scheme
+is
+did
+. The
+authority
+is a
+combination of
+<method-name>:<method-specific-id>
+, and the
+path
+,
+query
+, and
+fragment
+values are those defined in
+Path
+,
+Query
+, and
+Fragment
+,
+respectively.
+Relative
+DID URLs
+are often used to reference
+verification methods
+and
+services
+in a
+DID Document
+without having to use absolute
+URLs.
+DID methods
+where storage size is a consideration might use
+relative URLs to reduce the storage size of
+DID documents
+.
+Example
+6
+: An example of a relative DID URL
+{
+"@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1.1",
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"verificationMethod": [{
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1",
+"type": "Multikey",
+// external (property value)
+"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"publicKeyMultibase": "z6MkmM42vxfqZQsv4ehtTjFFxQ4sQKS2w6WR7emozFAn5cxu"
+}, ...],
+"authentication": [
+// a relative DID URL used to reference a verification method above
+"
+#key-1
+"
+]
+}
+In the example above, the relative
+DID URL
+value will be transformed to
+an absolute
+DID URL
+value of
+did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1
+.
+4.
+Data Model
+This specification defines a data model that can be used to express
+DID documents
+and their internal data structures, which can then be serialized
+into a concrete expression. This section provides a high-level description of
+the data model, descriptions of the ways different types of properties are
+expressed in the data model, and instructions for extending the data model.
+A
+DID document
+consists of a
+map
+of
+entries
+, where each entry consists of a
+key/value pair. The
+DID document
+data model contains properties that are
+specified in section
+5.
+Core Properties
+.
+All entry keys in the
+DID document
+data model are
+strings
+. All entry values are expressed using one
+of the data types in the table below, and each
+representation
+specifies the
+concrete serialization format of each data type.
+Data Type
+Considerations
+map
+A finite ordered sequence of key/value pairs, with no key appearing twice as
+specified in the
+Infra Standard
+. A map is sometimes referred to as an
+ordered map
+in the
+Infra Standard
+.
+list
+A finite ordered sequence of items as specified in the
+Infra Standard
+.
+set
+A finite ordered sequence of items that does not contain the same item twice
+as specified in the
+Infra Standard
+. A set is sometimes referred to as an
+ordered set
+in the
+Infra Standard
+.
+datetime
+A date and time value that is capable of losslessly expressing all values
+expressible by a
+dateTime
+as
+specified in [
+XMLSCHEMA11-2
+].
+string
+A sequence of code units often used to represent human readable language
+as specified in the
+Infra Standard
+.
+integer
+A
+real number without a fractional
+component
+as specified in [
+XMLSCHEMA11-2
+]. To maximize interoperability,
+implementers are urged to heed the advice regarding integers in
+RFC8259, Section 6: Numbers
+.
+double
+A
+real number with a fractional
+component
+that is often used to approximate arbitrary real numbers as
+specified in [
+XMLSCHEMA11-2
+]. To maximize interoperability, implementers are
+urged to heed the advice regarding doubles in
+RFC8259, Section 6: Numbers
+.
+boolean
+A value that is either true or false as defined in the
+Infra Standard
+.
+null
+A value that is used to indicate the lack of a value as defined in the
+Infra Standard
+.
+As a result of the
+data model
+being defined using
+terminology from the
+Infra Standard
+, property values which can contain more than
+one item, such as
+lists
+,
+maps
+, and
+sets
+, are explicitly ordered. All list-like
+value structures in the
+Infra Standard
+are ordered, whether or not that order is
+significant. For the purposes of this specification, unless otherwise stated,
+ordering of a
+map
+or
+set
+is not important and
+implementations are not expected to produce or consume deterministically ordered
+values.
+4.1
+Extensibility
+The data model supports two types of extensibility.
+For maximum interoperability, it is
+RECOMMENDED
+that extensions use the
+repository of
+Decentralized Identifier Extensions
+. The use of this mechanism for new
+properties or other extensions is the only specified mechanism that ensures that
+two different
+representations
+will be able to work together.
+Representations
+MAY
+define other extensibility mechanisms, including ones
+that do not require the use of the
+Decentralized Identifier Extensions
+repository. Such
+extension mechanisms
+SHOULD
+support lossless conversion into any other
+conformant
+representation
+. Extension mechanisms for a
+representation
+SHOULD
+define a mapping of all properties and
+representation
+syntax into the
+DID document
+data model
+and its type system.
+Note
+: Unregistered extensions are less reliable
+It is always possible for two specific implementations to agree out-of-band to
+use a mutually understood extension or
+representation
+that is not recorded
+in the repository of
+Decentralized Identifier Extensions
+; interoperability between such
+implementations and the larger ecosystem will be less reliable.
+5.
+Core Properties
+A
+DID
+is associated with a
+DID document
+, which is an extension
+of a
+controlled identifier document
+as defined in
+Controlled Identifiers v1.0
+.
+DID documents
+are expressed using the
+data model
+and can be serialized into a
+representation
+.
+The following sections define the properties in a
+DID document
+,
+including whether these properties are required or optional. These properties
+describe relationships between the
+DID subject
+and the value of the
+property.
+The following tables contain informative references for the core properties
+defined by this specification, with expected values, and whether or not they are
+required. The property names in the tables are linked to the normative
+definitions and more detailed descriptions of each property.
+Note
+: Property names used in maps of different types
+The property names
+id
+,
+type
+, and
+controller
+can be present in
+maps
+of different types
+with possible differences in constraints. For example, an
+id
+at the top-level of a
+DID document
+is required to be a DID, while an
+id
+in a
+service
+map
+can be a URL.

+5.1
+Identifiers
+This section describes the mechanisms by which
+DID documents
+include identifiers for
+DID subjects
+and
+DID controllers
+.
+5.1.1
+DID Subject
+The
+DID
+for a particular
+DID subject
+is expressed using the
+id
+property in the
+DID document
+. This property
+is defined in
+Section 2.1.1: Subjects
+of
+the
+Controlled Identifiers v1.0
+specification and extended by this specification to include
+decentralized identifiers
+as defined in Section
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+.
+Example
+7
+{
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghijk"
+}
+Note
+: Intermediate representations
+DID method
+specifications can create intermediate representations of a
+DID document
+, such as when a
+decentralized identifier
+is being registered in a
+verifiable data registry
+or when a
+DID resolver
+is performing
+DID resolution
+. These intermediate representations might not contain
+id
+values,
+or might contain interim values for certain
+id
+properties. Once the
+DID document
+is fully resolved, the final
+id
+value will be
+determined and put in place of the interim values throughout the
+DID document
+.
+5.1.2
+DID Controller
+A
+DID controller
+is an entity that is authorized to make changes to a
+DID document
+. This property is defined in
+Section 2.1.2: Controllers
+of
+the
+Controlled Identifiers v1.0
+specification and extended by this specification to include
+DIDs as defined in Section
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. The process of authorizing a
+DID controller
+is defined by the
+DID method
+.
+Example
+8
+: DID document with a controller property
+{
+"@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1.1",
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"controller": "did:example:bcehfew7h32f32h7af3"
+}
+5.1.3
+Identifier Restrictions
+Identifiers used in a
+DID document
+to identify a
+DID subject
+or a
+DID Controller
+cannot use query parameters or fragment identifiers.
+Implementers are urged to pay particular attention to the list of allowable
+characters in Section
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+which makes this requirement clear; the
+syntax does not include the
+?
+character nor the
+#
+character. This is in
+contrast to identifiers used in a
+DID document
+to identify a
+verification method
+or a
+service
+, which follow the syntax rules in Section
+3.2
+DID URL Syntax
+, which do allow the use of query parameters and fragment
+identifiers. Even so, the use of query parameters in long-lived canonical
+identifiers made for
+DID
+ecosystems is discouraged as it can increase the
+complexity of
+DID resolution
+software and potentially lead to a larger
+security attack surface. Fragment identifiers are also expected to be unique
+within a particular
+DID document
+and implementers are discouraged from
+reusing them to refer to different
+resources
+over time, such as two
+different
+verification methods
+within the same
+DID document
+.
+5.2
+Verification Methods
+A
+DID document
+can express
+verification methods
+, as defined in Section
+2.2: Verification Methods
+of
+Controlled Identifiers v1.0
+with the added restrictions that (a) the
+id
+value
+MUST
+conform to
+Section
+3.2
+DID URL Syntax
+or Section
+3.2.1
+Relative DID URLs
+and (b) the
+controller
+value
+MUST
+conform to Section
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+. See
+Section 2.2: Verification Methods

+Representations
+A concrete serialization of a
+DID document
+in this specification is called a
+representation
+. A
+representation
+is created by serializing the
+data model
+through a process called
+production
+. A
+representation
+is transformed into the
+data model
+through a process called
+consumption
+. The
+production
+and
+consumption
+processes enable the conversion of information from one
+representation
+to
+another. This specification defines a single
+representation
+for JSON, which
+is also compatible with processors that perform JSON-LD processing. The
+following sections define the general rules for
+production
+and
+consumption
+, as well as the JSON
+representation
+.
+6.1
+Production and Consumption
+In addition to the
+representations
+defined in this specification,
+implementers can use other
+representations
+, providing each such
+representation
+is properly specified (including rules for
+interoperable handling of properties not listed in the repository of
+DID Extensions [
+DID-EXTENSIONS
+]). See
+4.1
+Extensibility
+for more information.
+The requirements for all
+representations
+are as follows:
+A
+representation
+MUST
+define deterministic production and consumption
+rules for all data types specified in
+4.
+Data Model
+.
+A
+representation
+MUST
+be uniquely associated with an IANA-registered
+Media Type.
+A
+representation
+MUST
+define fragment processing rules for its Media
+Type that are conformant with the fragment processing rules defined in
+Fragment
+.
+A
+representation
+SHOULD
+use the lexical representation of
+data model
+data types. For example, JSON and JSON-LD use
+the XML Schema
+dateTime
+lexical serialization to represent
+datetimes
+. A
+representation
+MAY
+choose to serialize the
+data model
+data types using a different lexical
+serializations as long as the
+consumption
+process back into the
+data model
+is lossless. For example, some CBOR-based
+representations
+express
+datetime
+values using integers to
+represent the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.
+A
+representation
+MAY
+define
+representation-specific entries
+that
+are stored in a
+representation-specific entries
+map
+for use during the
+production
+and
+consumption
+process. These
+entries are used when consuming or producing to aid in ensuring lossless
+conversion.
+In order to maximize interoperability,
+representation
+specification
+authors
+SHOULD
+register their
+representation
+in the repository of
+DID Extensions [
+DID-EXTENSIONS
+].
+The requirements for all
+conforming producers
+are as follows:
+A
+conforming producer
+MUST
+take a
+DID document
+data model
+and a
+representation-specific entries
+map
+as input into the
+production
+process.
+The
+conforming producer
+MAY
+accept additional options as input
+into the
+production
+process.
+A
+conforming producer
+MUST
+serialize all entries in the
+DID document
+data model
+, and the
+representation-specific entries
+map
+,
+that do not
+have explicit processing rules for the
+representation
+being produced
+using only the
+representation
+'s data type processing rules and
+return the serialization after the
+production
+process completes.
+A
+conforming producer
+MUST
+return the Media Type
+string
+associated with the
+representation
+after the
+production
+process completes.
+A conforming producer
+MUST NOT
+produce non-conforming
+DIDs
+or
+DID documents
+.
+The requirements for all
+conforming consumers
+are as follows:
+A
+conforming consumer
+MUST
+take a
+representation
+and
+Media Type
+string
+as input into
+the
+consumption
+process. A
+conforming consumer
+MAY
+accept
+additional options as input into the
+consumption
+process.
+A
+conforming consumer
+MUST
+determine the
+representation
+of a
+DID document
+using the Media Type input
+string
+.
+A
+conforming consumer
+MUST
+detect any
+representation-specific entry
+across all known
+representations
+and place the entry into a
+representation-specific entries
+map
+which is returned after the
+consumption
+process completes. A list of
+all known
+representation-specific entries
+is available in the repository of
+DID Extensions [
+DID-EXTENSIONS
+].
+A
+conforming consumer
+MUST
+add all
+non-representation-specific entries
+that do not have explicit processing rules for the
+representation
+being
+consumed to the
+DID document
+data model
+using
+only the
+representation
+'s data type processing rules and return the
+DID document
+data model after the
+consumption
+process completes.
+A conforming consumer
+MUST
+produce errors when consuming non-conforming
+DIDs
+or
+DID documents
+.

+Note
+: Conversion between representations
+An implementation is expected to convert between
+representations
+by using
+the
+consumption
+rules on the source representation resulting in the
+data model
+and then using the
+production
+rules
+to serialize
+data model
+to the target representation,
+or any other mechanism that results in the same target representation.
+6.2
+JSON
+This section defines the
+production
+and
+consumption
+rules
+for the JSON
+representation
+.
+6.2.1
+Production
+The
+DID document
+, DID document data structures, and
+representation-specific entries
+map
+MUST
+be serialized to the JSON
+representation
+according to the following
+production
+rules:
+Data Type
+JSON Representation Type
+map
+A
+JSON Object
+, where each entry is
+serialized as a member of the JSON Object with the entry key as a
+JSON String
+member name and the entry value
+according to its type, as defined in this table.
+list
+A
+JSON Array
+, where each element of the
+list is serialized, in order, as a value of the array according to its type, as
+defined in this table.
+set
+A
+JSON Array
+, where each element of the set
+is added, in order, as a value of the array according to its type, as defined in
+this table.
+datetime
+A
+JSON String
+serialized as an
+XML Datetime
+normalized to
+UTC 00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision. For example:
+2020-12-20T19:17:47Z
+.
+string
+A
+JSON String
+.
+integer
+A
+JSON Number
+without a decimal or
+fractional component.
+double
+A
+JSON Number
+with a decimal and
+fractional component.
+boolean
+A
+JSON Boolean
+.
+null
+A
+JSON null literal
+.
+All implementers creating
+conforming producers
+that produce JSON
+representations
+are advised to ensure that their algorithms are aligned
+with the
+JSON
+serialization rules
+in the [
+INFRA
+] specification and the
+precision advisements regarding Numbers
+in the
+JSON [
+RFC8259
+] specification.
+All entries of a
+DID document
+MUST
+be included in the root
+JSON Object
+. Entries
+MAY
+contain additional
+data substructures subject to the value representation rules in the list above.
+When serializing a
+DID document
+, a
+conforming producer
+MUST
+specify a media type of
+application/did
+to downstream
+applications.
+Example
+9
+: Example DID document in JSON representation
+{
+"@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1.1",
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"authentication": [{
+"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
+"type": "Multikey",
+"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
+"publicKeyMultibase": "z6MkmM42vxfqZQsv4ehtTjFFxQ4sQKS2w6WR7emozFAn5cxu"
+}]
+}
+6.2.2
+Consumption
+The
+DID document
+and DID document data structures JSON
+representation
+MUST
+be deserialized into the
+data
+model
+according to the following
+consumption
+rules:
+JSON Representation Type
+Data Type
+JSON Object
+A
+map
+, where each member of the JSON
+Object is added as an entry to the map. Each entry key is set as the
+JSON Object member name. Each entry value is set by converting the JSON Object
+member value according to the JSON representation type as defined in this table.
+Since order is not specified by JSON Objects, no insertion order is guaranteed.
+JSON Array
+where the
+data model
+entry value is a
+list
+or unknown
+A
+list
+, where each value of the JSON Array is
+added to the list in order, converted based on the JSON representation type of
+the array value, as defined in this table.
+JSON Array
+where the
+data model
+entry value is a
+set
+A
+set
+, where each value of
+the JSON Array is added to the set in order, converted based on the JSON
+representation type of the array value, as defined in this table.
+JSON String
+where
+data model
+entry value is a
+datetime
+A
+datetime
+.
+JSON String
+, where the
+data model
+entry value type is
+string
+or
+unknown
+A
+string
+.
+JSON Number
+without a decimal or
+fractional component
+An
+integer
+.
+JSON Number
+with a decimal and fractional
+component, or when entry value is a
+double
+regardless of inclusion of
+fractional component
+A
+double
+.
+JSON Boolean
+A
+boolean
+.
+JSON null literal
+A
+null
+value.
+All implementers creating
+conforming producers
+or
+conforming consumers
+are advised to ensure that their algorithms are aligned with the
+JSON
+conversion rules
+in the [
+INFRA
+] specification and the
+precision advisements regarding Numbers
+in the
+JSON [
+RFC8259
+] specification.
+If media type information is available to a
+conforming consumer
+and the
+media type value is
+application/did
+, then the data structure
+being consumed is a
+DID document
+, and the root element
+MUST
+be a
+JSON Object
+where all members of the object
+are entries of the
+DID document
+. A
+conforming consumer
+for a JSON
+representation
+that is consuming a
+DID document
+with a root
+element that is not a
+JSON Object
+MUST
+report an error.
+6.2.3
+JSON-LD Processors
+JSON-LD
+is a JSON-based format used to serialize
+Linked Data
+. Some
+implementations are expected to process
+DID documents
+using the standard
+JSON-LD Processing algorithms. To maximize interoperability, implementers
+are strongly advised to ensure that JSON-LD Processing using standards-compliant
+libraries is not prevented. The semantics of a
+DID document
+are the same
+whether JSON-LD Processing using standards-compliant libraries is performed or
+not. Any difference in semantics is an error in either implementation or DID
+Method specification.
+For JSON-LD processing to occur, a
+@context
+property
+MUST
+be specified
+according to the rules specified in the
+JSON-LD 1.1
+specification.
+@context
+The
+JSON-LD Context
+is either a
+string
+or a
+list
+containing any combination of
+strings
+and/or
+ordered
+maps
+.
+The
+DID document
+, DID document data structures, and
+representation-specific entries
+map
+MUST
+be serialized to the JSON
+representation
+according to the JSON
+representation
+production
+rules as defined in
+6.2
+JSON
+.
+In addition to using the JSON
+representation
+production
+rules,
+production
+MUST
+include the
+@context
+entry. The serialized value of
+@context
+MUST
+be the
+JSON
+String
+https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1.1
+, or a
+JSON Array
+where the first item is the
+JSON String
+https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1.1
+and the subsequent items are
+serialized according to the JSON
+production
+rules.
+Example
+10
+: A valid serialization of a simple @context entry
+{
+"@context"
+:
+"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1.1"
+,
+...
+}
+Example
+11
+: A valid serialization of a layered @context entry
+{
+"@context"
+: [
+"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1.1"
+,
+"https://did-method-extension.example/v1"
+],
+...
+}
+All implementers creating
+conforming consumers
+that produce or consume
+representations
+meant to be processed as JSON-LD are advised to ensure that
+their algorithms produce valid
+JSON-LD
+documents. Invalid JSON-LD
+documents will cause JSON-LD processors to halt and report errors.
+To achieve interoperability across different
+representations
+,
+all JSON-LD Contexts and their terms
+SHOULD
+be registered in the repository of
+Decentralized Identifier Extensions
+.
+A
+conforming producer
+that generates a JSON-LD
+representation
+SHOULD NOT
+produce a
+DID document
+that contains terms not defined via the
+@context
+as
+conforming consumers
+are expected to remove
+unknown terms. When serializing a JSON-LD
+representation
+of a
+DID document
+, a
+conforming producer
+MUST
+specify a media type of
+application/did
+to downstream applications.
+Conforming consumers
+that process a JSON-LD
+representation
+SHOULD
+drop all terms from a
+DID document
+that are not defined via the
+@context
+.
+6.3
+Media Types
+Media types, as defined in [
+RFC6838
+], identify the syntax used to express a
+DID document
+as well as other useful processing guidelines.
+Syntaxes used to express the data model in this specification
+SHOULD
+be
+identified by a media type, and conventions outlined in this section
+SHOULD
+be
+followed when defining or using media types with
+DID documents
+.
+There is one media type associated with the core data model, which is
+listed in Section
+E.
+IANA Considerations
+:
+application/did
+.
+6.3.1
+Media Type Precision
+This section is non-normative.
+At times, developers or systems might use lower-precision media types to convey
+DID documents
+. Some of the reasons for use of lower-precision media types
+include:
+A web server defaults to
+text/plain
+or
+application/octet-stream
+when a file
+extension is not available and it cannot determine the media type.
+A developer adds a file extension that leads to a media type that is less
+specific than the content of the file. For example,
+.json
+could result in a
+media type of
+application/json
+and
+.jsonld
+might result in a media type of
+application/ld+json
+.
+A protocol requires a less precise media type for a particular transaction; for
+example,
+application/json
+instead of
+application/did
+,
+Implementers are discouraged from raising errors when it is possible to determine
+the intended media type from the payload, provided that the media type used is
+acceptable in the given protocol. For example, if an application only accepts
+payloads that conform to the rules associated with the
+application/did
+media
+type, but the payload is tagged with the lower-precision
+application/json
+or
+application/ld+json
+, the application might perform the following steps to
+determine whether the payload also conforms to the higher-precision media type:
+Parse the payload as a JSON document.
+Ensure that the first element of the
+@context
+property matches
+https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1.1
+.
+Assume an
+application/did
+media type if the JSON document contains a top-level
+id
+property containing an identifier that conforms to the rules in Section
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+.
+Whenever possible, implementers are advised to use the most precise (the highest-
+precision) media type for all payloads defined by this specification.
+Implementers are also advised to recognize that a payload tagged with a lower-
+precision media type does not mean that the payload does not meet the rules
+necessary to tag it with a higher-precision type. Similarly, a payload tagged
+with a higher-precision media type does not mean that the payload will meet the
+requirements associated with the media type. Receivers of payloads, regardless
+of their associated media type, are expected to perform appropriate checks to
+ensure that payloads conform with the requirements for their use in a given
+system.
+HTTP clients and servers use media types associated with
+DID documents
+in
+Accept:
+headers and when indicating content types. Implementers are warned that
+HTTP servers might ignore the
+Accept:
+header and return another content type, or
+return an error code such as
+415
+Unsupported Media Type
+.
+7.
+Methods
+A
+conforming DID method
+defines how implementers can realize the features
+described by this specification.
+DID methods
+are often associated with a
+particular
+verifiable data registry
+. New
+DID methods
+are defined in
+their own specifications to enable interoperability between different
+implementations of the same
+DID method
+.
+Conceptually, the relationship between this specification and a
+DID method
+specification is similar to the relationship between the IETF generic
+URI
+specification [
+RFC3986
+] and a specific
+URI
+scheme
+[
+IANA-URI-SCHEMES
+], such as the
+http
+scheme [
+RFC9110
+]. In
+addition to defining a specific
+DID scheme
+, a
+DID method
+specification also defines the mechanisms for creating, resolving, updating, and
+deactivating
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+using a specific type of
+verifiable data registry
+. It also documents all implementation
+considerations related to
+DIDs
+as well as Security and Privacy
+Considerations.
+This section specifies the requirements for authoring
+DID method
+specifications.
+7.1
+Method Syntax
+The requirements for all
+DID method
+specifications when defining the
+method-specific DID Syntax are as follows:
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+define exactly one method-specific
+DID scheme
+that is identified by exactly one method name as specified by the
+method-name
+rule in
+3.1
+DID Syntax
+.
+The
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+specify how to generate the
+method-specific-id
+component of a
+DID
+.
+The
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+define sensitivity and normalization of
+the value of the
+method-specific-id
+.
+The
+method-specific-id
+value
+MUST
+be unique within a
+DID method
+. The
+method-specific-id
+value itself might be globally
+unique.
+Any
+DID
+generated by a
+DID method
+MUST
+be globally unique.
+To reduce the chances of
+method-name
+conflicts, a
+DID method
+specification
+SHOULD
+be registered in the repository of DID Extensions
+[
+DID-EXTENSIONS
+].
+A
+DID method
+MAY
+define multiple
+method-specific-id
+formats.
+The
+method-specific-id
+format
+MAY
+include colons. The use of
+colons
+MUST
+comply syntactically with the
+method-specific-id
+ABNF
+rule.
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MAY
+specify ABNF rules for
+DID paths
+that are more restrictive than the generic rules in
+Path
+.
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MAY
+specify ABNF rules for
+DID queries
+that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MAY
+specify ABNF rules for
+DID fragments
+that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
+Note
+: Colons in method-specific-id
+The meaning of colons in the
+method-specific-id
+is entirely
+method-specific. Colons might be used by
+DID methods
+for establishing
+hierarchically partitioned namespaces, for identifying specific instances or
+parts of the
+verifiable data registry
+, or for other purposes.
+Implementers are advised to avoid assuming any meanings or
+behaviors associated with a colon that are generically applicable to all
+DID methods
+.
+7.2
+Method Operations
+The requirements for all
+DID method
+specifications when defining the
+method operations are as follows:
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+define how authorization is performed to
+execute all operations, including any necessary cryptographic processes.
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+specify how a
+DID controller
+creates a
+DID
+and its associated
+DID document
+.
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+specify how a
+DID resolver
+uses a
+DID
+to resolve a
+DID document
+, including how the
+DID resolver
+can verify the authenticity of the response.
+A
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+specify what constitutes an update to a
+DID document
+and how a
+DID controller
+can update a
+DID document
+or
+state that updates are not possible.
+The
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+specify how a
+DID controller
+can
+deactivate a
+DID
+or
+state that deactivation is not possible.
+The authority of a party that is performing authorization to carry out the
+operations is specific to a
+DID method
+. For example, a
+DID method
+might —
+make use of the
+controller
+property.
+use the
+verification methods
+listed under
+authentication
+.
+use other constructs in the
+DID Document
+such as the
+verification method
+specified via the
+capabilityInvocation
+verification relationship
+.
+not use the
+DID document
+for this decision at all, and depend on an
+out-of-band mechanism, instead.
+When executing method operations, a
+DID method
+can use any data structures
+it requires, including intermediate, partial, or temporary
+DID documents
+, as
+long as they are kept internal to the DID method, and the DID documents returned
+by the method operations are fully conformant, as defined in
+1.4
+Conformance
+.
+7.3
+Security Requirements
+The requirements for all
+DID method
+specifications when authoring the
+Security Considerations
+section are as follows:
+A
+DID method
+specifications
+MUST
+follow all guidelines and normative
+language provided in
+RFC3552: Writing Security
+Considerations Sections
+for the
+DID
+operations defined in the
+DID method
+specification.
+The Security Considerations section
+MUST
+document the following forms of attack
+for the
+DID
+operations defined in the
+DID method
+specification:
+eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, denial of
+service,
+amplification
+, and man-in-the-middle. Other known
+forms of attack
+SHOULD
+also be documented.
+The Security Considerations section
+MUST
+discuss residual risks, such as the
+risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation, or cipher
+after threat mitigation was deployed.
+The Security Considerations section
+MUST
+provide integrity protection and update
+authentication for all operations required by Section
+7.2
+Method Operations
+.
+If authentication is involved, particularly user-host authentication, the
+security characteristics of the authentication method
+MUST
+be clearly
+documented.
+The Security Considerations section
+MUST
+discuss the policy mechanism by which
+DIDs
+are proven to be uniquely assigned.
+Method-specific endpoint authentication
+MUST
+be discussed. Where
+DID methods
+make use of
+DLTs
+with varying network topology, sometimes
+offered as
+light node
+or
+thin client
+implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security assumptions
+of the topology available to implementations of the

+MUST
+be
+discussed.
+If a protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, the
+DID method
+specification
+MUST
+clearly indicate which portions of the data are
+protected and by what protections, and it
+SHOULD
+give an indication of the
+sorts of attacks to which the cryptographic protection is susceptible. Some
+examples are integrity only, confidentiality, and endpoint authentication.
+Data which is to be held secret (keying material, random seeds, and so on)
+SHOULD
+be clearly labeled.
+DID method
+specifications
+SHOULD
+explain and specify the implementation
+of signatures on
+DID documents
+, if applicable.
+Where
+DID methods
+use peer-to-peer computing resources, such as with all
+known
+DLTs
+, the expected burdens of those resources
+SHOULD
+be discussed
+in relation to denial of service.
+DID methods

+,
+SHOULD
+consider the

+7.4
+Privacy Requirements
+The requirements for all
+DID method
+specifications when authoring the
+Privacy Considerations
+section are:
+The
+DID method
+specification's Privacy Considerations section
+MUST
+discuss any subsection of Section 5 of [
+RFC6973
+] that could apply in a
+method-specific manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored
+data compromise, unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation,
+identification, secondary use, disclosure, and exclusion.
+8.
+Security Considerations
+This section is non-normative.
+This section contains a variety of security considerations that people using
+Decentralized Identifiers are advised to consider before deploying this
+technology in a production setting. Readers are urged to read the
+Security Considerations
+section
+of the
+Controlled Identifiers v1.0
+specification before reading
+this section.
+DIDs
+are designed to operate under
+the threat model used by many IETF standards and documented
+in [
+RFC3552
+]. This section elaborates upon a number of the considerations
+in [
+RFC3552
+], as well as other considerations that are unique to
+DID
+architecture.
+8.1
+Choosing DID Resolvers
+The repository of DID Extensions [
+DID-EXTENSIONS
+] contains an
+informative list of
+DID method
+names and their corresponding
+DID method
+specifications. Implementers need to bear in mind that there is no
+central authority to mandate which
+DID method
+specification is to be used
+with any specific
+DID method
+name. If there is doubt on whether or not a
+specific
+DID resolver
+implements a
+DID method
+correctly, the DID
+Specification Registries can be used to look up the registered specification
+and make an informed decision regarding which
+DID resolver
+implementation to use.
+8.2
+Non-Repudiation
+Non-repudiation of
+DIDs
+and
+DID document
+updates is supported if:
+The
+verifiable data registry
+supports
+verifiable timestamps
+. See "DID Document Metadata" in [
+DID-RESOLUTION
+]
+for further information on useful timestamps that can be used during the
+DID resolution
+process.
+The subject is monitoring for unauthorized updates as elaborated upon in
+8.3
+Notification of DID Document Changes
+.
+The subject has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious updates according
+to the authorization mechanism for the
+DID method
+.
+8.3
+Notification of DID Document Changes
+One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a
+DID document
+is
+monitoring and actively notifying the
+DID subject
+when there are changes.
+This is analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
+username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to the email
+addresses on file.
+In the case of a
+DID
+, there is no intermediary registrar or account
+provider to generate such notifications. However, if the
+verifiable data registry
+on which the
+DID
+is registered directly supports change
+notifications, a subscription service can be offered to
+DID controllers
+.
+Notifications could be sent directly to the relevant
+service endpoints
+listed in an existing
+DID
+.
+If a
+DID controller
+chooses to rely on a third-party monitoring service
+(other than the
+verifiable data registry
+itself), this introduces another
+vector of attack.
+8.4
+Revocation in Trustless Systems
+Trustless systems are those where all trust is derived from cryptographically
+provable assertions, and more specifically, where no metadata outside of the
+cryptographic system is factored into the determination of trust in the system.
+To verify a signature of proof for a
+verification method
+which has been
+revoked in a trustless system, a
+DID method
+needs to support either or
+both of the
+versionId
+or
+versionTime
+, as well as both the
+updated
+and
+nextUpdate
+,
+DID document
+metadata properties. A verifier can validate a
+signature or proof of a revoked key if and only if all of the following are
+true:
+The proof or signature includes the
+versionId
+or
+versionTime
+of the
+DID document
+that was used at the point in time at which the signature or
+proof was made.
+The verifier can determine the point in time at which the signature or proof was
+made; for example, it was anchored on a blockchain.
+In the resolved
+DID document
+metadata, the
+updated
+timestamp is
+before, and the
+nextUpdate
+timestamp is after, the point in time at which the
+signature or proof was made.
+Similar trust may be achieved in systems that are willing to accept metadata
+beyond that which constitutes cryptographic input -- but this always requires
+a careful judgment about whether a
+DID document
+'s content included the
+expected content at the moment of a signing event.
+8.5
+DID Recovery
+Recovery is a reactive security measure whereby a
+controller
+that has
+lost the ability to perform DID operations, such as through the loss of a
+device, is able to regain the ability to perform DID operations.
+The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of
+DID
+recovery:
+Proactively performing recovery, on an infrequent but regular basis, can help to
+prevent loss of control.
+It is considered a best practice to never reuse cryptographic material
+associated with recovery for any other purposes.
+Recovery is commonly performed in conjunction with
+verification method rotation
+and
+verification method
+revocation
+.
+Recovery is advised when a
+controller
+or any service trusted to act on
+their behalf no longer has the exclusive ability to perform DID operations as
+described in
+7.2
+Method Operations
+.
+DID method
+specifications might choose to enable support for a quorum of
+trusted parties to facilitate recovery. Some of the facilities to do so are
+suggested in
+5.1.2
+DID Controller
+.
+Not all
+DID method
+specifications will recognize control from
+DIDs
+registered using other
+DID methods
+and they might restrict third-party
+control to
+DIDs
+that use the same method.
+Access control and recovery in a
+DID method
+specification can also
+include a time lock feature to protect against key compromise by maintaining a
+second track of control for recovery.
+There are currently no common recovery mechanisms that apply to all
+DID methods
+.
+8.6
+The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers
+DIDs
+achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central
+registration authority. This comes at the cost of human memorability.
+Algorithms capable of generating globally unambiguous identifiers
+produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This
+trade-off is often referred to as
+Zooko's
+Triangle
+.
+There are use cases where it is desirable to discover a
+DID
+when
+starting from a human-friendly identifier. For example, a natural language
+name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a
+DID controller
+,
+such as a mobile telephone number, email address, social media username, or
+blog URL. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to
+DIDs
+, and doing so in a way that can be verified and trusted, is
+outside the scope of this specification.
+Solutions to this problem are defined in separate specifications, such as
+[
+DNS-DID
+], that reference this specification. It is strongly recommended that
+such specifications carefully consider the:
+Numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly
+identifier for a target entity.
+Privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently
+correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.
+8.7
+DIDs as Enhanced URNs
+If desired by a
+DID controller
+, a
+DID
+or a
+DID URL
+is
+capable of acting as persistent, location-independent resource identifier.
+These sorts of identifiers
+are classified as Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and are defined in [
+RFC8141
+].
+DIDs
+are an enhanced form of URN that provide a
+cryptographically secure, location-independent identifier for a digital
+resource, while also providing metadata that enables retrieval. Due to the
+indirection between the
+DID document
+and the
+DID
+itself, the
+DID controller
+can adjust the actual location of the resource — or
+even provide the resource directly — without adjusting the
+DID
+.
+DIDs
+of this type can definitively verify that the resource retrieved is,
+in fact, the resource identified.
+A
+DID controller
+who intends to use a
+DID
+for this purpose is
+advised to follow the security considerations in [
+RFC8141
+]. In particular:
+The
+DID controller
+is expected to choose a
+DID method
+that
+supports the controller's requirements for persistence. The Decentralized
+Characteristics Rubric [
+DID-RUBRIC
+] is one tool available to help
+implementers decide upon the most suitable
+DID method
+.
+The
+DID controller
+is expected to publish its operational policies so
+requesting parties can determine the degree to which they can rely on the
+persistence of a
+DID
+controlled by that
+DID controller
+. In the
+absence of such policies, requesting parties are not expected to make any
+assumption about whether a
+DID
+is a persistent identifier for the same
+DID subject
+.
+8.8
+Immutability
+Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and the
+assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Immutability of
+DID documents
+can provide some security benefits. Individual
+DID methods
+ought to
+consider constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics they do not
+need. The more
+locked down
+a
+DID method
+is, while providing the
+same set of features, the less it can be manipulated by malicious actors.
+As an example, consider that a single edit to a
+DID document
+can change
+anything except the root
+id
+property of the document. But
+is it actually desirable for a
+service
+to change its
+type
+after it is defined? Or for a key to change its value? Or
+would it be better to require a new
+id
+when certain
+fundamental properties of an object change? Malicious takeovers of a website
+often aim for an outcome where the site keeps its host name identifier,
+but is subtly changed underneath. If certain properties of the site, such
+as the
+ASN
+associated with its IP address, were required by the specification to be
+immutable, anomaly detection would be easier, and attacks would be much
+harder and more expensive to carry out.
+For
+DID methods
+tied to a global source of truth, a direct,
+just-in-time lookup of the latest version of a
+DID document
+is always
+possible. However, it seems likely that layers of cache might eventually sit
+between a
+DID resolver
+and that source of truth. If they do, believing
+the attributes of an object in the
+DID document
+to have a given state
+when they are actually subtly different might invite exploits. This is
+particularly true if some lookups are of a full
+DID document
+, and
+others are of partial data where the larger context is assumed.
+8.9
+Encrypted Data in DID Documents
+Encryption algorithms have been known to fail due to advances in cryptography
+and computing power. Implementers are advised to assume that any encrypted data
+placed in a
+DID document
+might eventually be made available in clear text
+to the same audience to which the encrypted data is available. This is
+particularly pertinent if the
+DID document
+is public.
+Encrypting all or parts of a
+DID document
+is
+not
+an appropriate
+means to protect data in the long term. Similarly, placing encrypted data in
+a
+DID document
+is not an appropriate means to protect personal data.
+Given the caveats above, if encrypted data is included in a
+DID document
+,
+implementers are advised to not associate any correlatable information
+that could be used to infer a relationship between the encrypted data
+and an associated party. Examples of correlatable information include
+public keys of a receiving party, identifiers to digital assets known to be
+under the control of a receiving party, or human readable descriptions of a
+receiving party.
+8.10
+Equivalence Properties
+Given the
+equivalentId
+and
+canonicalId
+properties are generated by
+DID methods
+themselves, the same security and
+accuracy guarantees that apply to the resolved
+DID
+present in the
+id
+field of a
+DID document
+also apply to these properties.
+The
+alsoKnownAs
+property is not guaranteed to be an accurate
+statement of equivalence, and should not be relied upon without performing
+validation steps beyond the resolution of the
+DID document
+.
+The
+equivalentId
+and
+canonicalId
+properties express equivalence assertions to variants of a single
+DID
+produced by the same
+DID method
+and can be trusted to the extent the
+requesting party trusts the
+DID method
+and a conforming producer and
+resolver.
+The
+alsoKnownAs
+property permits an equivalence assertion to
+URIs
+that are not governed by the same
+DID method
+and cannot be
+trusted without performing verification steps outside of the governing
+DID method
+. See additional guidance in
+Section 2.1.3: Also Known As
+of the
+Controlled Identifiers v1.0
+specification.
+As with any other security-related properties in the
+DID document
+,
+parties relying on any equivalence statement in a
+DID document
+should
+guard against the values of these properties being substituted by an attacker
+after the proper verification has been performed. Any write access to a
+DID document
+stored in memory or disk after verification has been performed is
+an attack vector that might circumvent verification unless the
+DID document
+is re-verified.
+8.11
+Persistence
+DIDs
+are designed to be persistent such that a
+controller
+need not
+rely upon a single trusted third party or administrator to maintain their
+identifiers. In an ideal case, no administrator can take control away from the
+controller
+, nor can an administrator prevent their identifiers' use for
+any particular purpose such as authentication, authorization, and attestation.
+No third party can act on behalf of a
+controller
+to remove or render
+inoperable an entity's identifier without the
+controller
+'s consent.
+However, it is important to note that in all
+DID methods
+that enable
+cryptographic proof-of-control, the means of proving control can always be
+transferred to another party by transferring the secret cryptographic material.
+Therefore, it is vital that systems relying on the persistence of an identifier
+over time regularly check to ensure that the identifier is, in fact, still under
+the control of the intended party.
+Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine from the cryptography alone whether
+or not the secret cryptographic material associated with a given
+verification method
+has been compromised. It might well be that the
+expected
+controller
+still has access to the secret cryptographic material
+— and as such can execute a proof-of-control as part of a verification
+process — while at the same time, a bad actor also has access to those
+same keys, or to a copy thereof.
+As such, cryptographic proof-of-control is expected to only be used as one
+factor in evaluating the level of identity assurance required for high-stakes
+scenarios.
+DID
+-based authentication provides much greater assurance than
+a username and password, thanks to the ability to determine control over a
+cryptographic secret without transmitting that secret between systems. However,
+it is not infallible. Scenarios that involve sensitive, high value, or
+life-critical operations are expected to use additional factors as appropriate.
+In addition to potential ambiguity from use by different
+controllers
+, it
+is impossible to guarantee, in general, that a given
+DID
+is being used in
+reference to the same subject at any given point in time. It is technically
+possible for the controller to reuse a
+DID
+for different subjects and,
+more subtly, for the precise definition of the subject to either change over
+time or be misunderstood.
+For example, consider a
+DID
+used for a sole proprietorship, receiving
+various credentials used for financial transactions. To the
+controller
+,
+that identifier referred to the business. As the business grows, it eventually
+gets incorporated as a Limited Liability Company. The
+controller
+continues using that same
+DID
+, because to
+them
+the
+DID
+refers to the business. However, to the state, the tax authority, and
+the local municipality, the
+DID
+no longer refers to the same entity.
+Whether or not the subtle shift in meaning matters to a credit provider or
+supplier is necessarily up to them to decide. In many cases, as long as the
+bills get paid and collections can be enforced, the shift is immaterial.
+Due to these potential ambiguities,
+DIDs
+are to be considered valid
+contextually
+rather than absolutely. Their persistence does not imply
+that they refer to the exact same subject, nor that they are under the control
+of the same
+controller
+. Instead, one needs to understand the context in
+which the
+DID
+was created, how it is used, and consider the likely shifts
+in their meaning, and adopt procedures and policies to address both potential
+and inevitable semantic drift.
+8.12
+Evaluating Competing Considerations
+This section is non-normative.
+This specification does not require or suggest the use of any specific type of
+verifiable data registry
+. Different use cases might result in different
+requirements. Different requirements might suggest different considerations with different
+trade-offs. For example, trade-offs between computation (energy usage), trust
+(deference to authority), coordination (network bandwidth), or memory (physical
+storage) might or might not be appropriate for any given use case. Other use cases
+might not make the same trade-offs. Those that need to consider different criteria
+for their use case are directed to the
+DID Method Rubric
+, which provides
+evaluation criteria to help decision makers determine whether or not a particular
+DID Method
+is appropriate for their use cases.
+9.
+Privacy Considerations
+This section is non-normative.
+Since
+DIDs
+and
+DID documents
+are designed to be administered
+directly by the
+DID controller(s)
+, it is critically important to apply
+the principles of Privacy by Design [
+PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN
+] to all aspects of the
+decentralized identifier
+architecture. All seven of these principles
+have been applied throughout the development of this specification. The design
+used in this specification does not assume that there is a registrar, hosting
+company, nor other intermediate service provider to recommend or apply
+additional privacy safeguards. Privacy in this specification is preventive,
+not remedial, and is an embedded default. Before reading this section, readers
+are urged to read the
+Privacy Considerations
+section
+of the
+Controlled Identifiers v1.0
+specification, as it contains
+more general privacy considerations that also apply to
+DIDs
+. The rest
+of this section covers privacy considerations that are specific to
+decentralized identifiers
+and are in addition to the guidance provided
+in the
+Controlled Identifiers v1.0
+specification.
+9.1
+Group Privacy
+When a
+DID subject
+is indistinguishable from others in the group,
+privacy is available. When the act of engaging privately with another party is
+by itself a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished.
+DIDs
+and
+DID methods
+need to work to improve group privacy, particularly for those who
+legitimately need it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces that
+default to preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. To reduce
+digital
+fingerprints
+, share common settings across requesting party
+implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum on wire protocols, use
+encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to standard lengths.

+Detailed overview of DID architecture and the relationship of the basic components.
+B.2
+Creation of a DID
+This section is non-normative.
+The creation of a
+DID
+is a process that is defined by each
+DID Method
+. Some
+DID Methods
+, such as
+did:key
+, are purely
+generative, such that a
+DID
+and a
+DID document
+are generated by
+transforming a single piece of cryptographic material into a conformant
+representation
+. Other
+DID methods
+might require the use of a
+verifiable data registry
+, where the
+DID
+and
+DID document
+are recognized to exist by third parties only when the registration has been
+completed, as defined by the respective
+DID method
+. Other processes
+might be defined by the respective
+DID method
+.
+B.3
+Determining the DID subject
+This section is non-normative.
+A
+DID
+is a specific type of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), so a
+DID
+can refer to any resource. Per [
+RFC3986
+]:
+the term "resource" is used in a general sense for whatever might be
+identified by a URI. [...] A resource is not necessarily
+accessible via the Internet.
+Resources can be digital or physical, abstract or concrete. Any resource that
+can be assigned a URI can be assigned a
+DID
+. The resource referred to
+by the
+DID
+is the
+DID subject
+.
+The
+DID controller
+determines the
+DID subject
+.
+It is not expected to be possible to determine the
+DID subject
+from looking at the
+DID
+itself, as
+DIDs
+are generally
+only meaningful to machines, not human. A
+DID
+is unlikely to contain
+any information about the
+DID subject
+, so further information
+about the
+DID subject
+is only discoverable by resolving the
+DID
+to the
+DID document
+, obtaining a verifiable credential about the
+DID
+, or via some other description of the
+DID
+.
+While the value of the
+id
+property in the retrieved
+DID document
+must always match the
+DID
+being resolved, whether
+or not the actual resource to which the
+DID
+refers can change over time
+is dependent upon the
+DID method
+. For example, a
+DID method
+that permits the
+DID subject
+to change could be used to generate a
+DID
+for the current occupant of a particular role—such as the CEO
+of a company—where the actual person occupying the role can be different
+depending on when the
+DID
+is resolved.
+B.4
+Referring to the DID document
+This section is non-normative.
+The
+DID
+refers to the
+DID subject
+and
+resolves to
+the
+DID document
+(by following the protocol specified by the
+DID method
+). The
+DID document
+is not a separate resource from
+the
+DID subject
+and does not have a
+URI
+separate from the
+DID
+. Rather the
+DID document
+is an artifact of
+DID resolution
+controlled by the
+DID controller
+for the purpose of
+describing the
+DID subject
+.
+This distinction is illustrated by the graph model shown below.

+Two filled black circles appear at the top of the diagram, one on the left,
+labeled "DID Controller", and one on the right, labeled "DID Subject". A
+rectangle, with lower right corner bent inwards to form a small triangle,
+appears below, containing the label "DID Document". Arrows extend between these
+three items, as follows. A solid red arrow points directly from the DID
+Controller circle, rightwards to the DID Subject circle, labeled "DID" above it
+in large font, and "Identifies" below it in small italic font. The other arrow
+labels are also in small italic font. A dotted red arrow, labeled "Resolves
+to", extends from DID Controller, starting in the same line as the first arrow,
+then curving downward to point to the DID Document rectangle. A green arrow,
+labeled "Controls", points directly from DID Controller to DID Document. A
+green arrow labeled "Controller" points in the opposite direction, from DID
+Document to DID Controller, making an arc outward to the left of the diagram. A
+blue arrow, labeled, "Describes" points directly from DID Document to DID
+Subject.
+B.5
+Statements in the DID document
+This section is non-normative.
+Each property in a
+DID document
+is a statement by the
+DID controller
+that describes:
+The string of characters defining identifiers for the
+DID subject
+(e.g., the
+id
+and
+alsoKnownAs
+properties)
+How to interact with the
+DID subject
+(e.g., the
+verificationMethod
+and
+service
+properties).
+How to interpret the specific representation of the
+DID document
+(e.g., the
+@context
+property for a JSON-LD representation).
+The only required property in a
+DID document
+is
+id
+,
+so that is the only statement guaranteed to be in a
+DID document
+.
+That statement is illustrated in
+Figure
+5
+with a direct link between the
+DID
+and the
+DID subject
+.
+B.6
+Discovering more information about the DID subject
+This section is non-normative.
+Options for discovering more information about the
+DID subject
+depend
+on the properties present in the
+DID document
+. If the
+service
+property is present, more information can be
+requested from a
+service endpoint
+. For example, by querying a
+service endpoint
+that supports verifiable credentials for one or more
+claims (attributes) describing the
+DID subject
+.
+Another option is to use the
+alsoKnownAs
+property if it
+is present in the
+DID document
+. The
+DID controller
+can use it
+to provide a list of other URIs (including other
+DIDs
+) that refer to
+the same
+DID subject
+. Resolving or dereferencing these URIs might yield
+other descriptions or representations of the
+DID subject
+as
+illustrated in the figure below.
+Figure
+6
+A
+DID document
+can use the alsoKnownAs property to assert that another
+URI
+(including, but not necessarily, another
+DID
+) refers to the
+same
+DID subject
+. See also:
+narrative description
+.
+The diagram contains three small black filled circles, two rectangles with bent
+corners, arrows between them, and labels, as follows. On the upper left is a
+circle labeled "DID Controller". On the upper right is a circle labeled "DID
+Subject". On the lower-middle right is a circle without a label. On the lower
+right is a rectangle labeled "Description". In the center of the diagram is a
+rectangle labeled "DID Document". Inside the DID Document rectangle, beneath
+its label, is two lines of code: "alsoKnownAs: [", and "URI]". A black arrow
+extends from the second line, to the right, crossing the rectangle border,
+pointing to the unlabeled circle at the right of the diagram. This arrow is
+labeled above it in large font, "URI", and below it in italic, "Identifies". A
+black arrow points from the unlabeled circle downwards to the Description
+rectangle, labeled "Dereferences to". A blue arrow, labeled "Describes",
+extends from Description, arcing on the right, pointing up to DID Subject. A
+blue arrow, also labeled "Describes", points directly from the rectangle,
+labeled "DID Document", in the center of the diagram, up and to the right to the
+DID Subject circle. A red arrow, labeled "alsoKnownAs", points from DID Subject
+down to the unlabeled circle. A red arrow, labeled "DID" above it in large font,
+and "Identifies" below it in italic font, lies at the top of the image, pointing
+from DID Controller to DID Subject. A dotted red line starts in the same place
+but branches off and curves downward to point to the DID Document rectangle at
+the center of the image. A green arrow, labeled "Controls", points directly
+from DID Controller to DID Document. Another green arrow points in the opposite
+direction, labeled "Controller", curving outwards on the left of the image,
+from DID Document to DID Controller.
+B.7
+Serving a representation of the DID subject
+This section is non-normative.
+If the
+DID subject
+is a digital resource that can be retrieved
+from the internet, a
+DID method
+can choose to construct a
+DID URL
+which returns a representation of the
+DID subject
+itself. For example,
+a data schema that needs a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier
+could be assigned a
+DID
+, and passing a specified
+Path
+or
+Query
+could be used as a standard way to retrieve a
+representation of that schema.
+Similarly, a
+DID
+can be used to refer to a digital resource (such as
+an image) that can be returned directly from a
+verifiable data registry
+if that functionality is supported by the applicable
+DID method
+.
+B.8
+Assigning DIDs to existing web resources
+This section is non-normative.
+If the controller of a web page or any other web resource wants to
+assign it a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier, the
+controller can give it a
+DID
+. For example, the author of a blog
+hosted by a blog hosting company (under that hosting company's domain)
+could create a
+DID
+for the blog. In the
+DID document
+, the
+author can include the
+alsoKnownAs
+property pointing to
+the current URL of the blog, e.g.:
+"alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.blogging-host.example/home"]
+If the author subsequently moves the blog to a different hosting company
+(or to the author's own domain), the author can update the
+DID document
+to point to the new URL for the blog, e.g.:
+"alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.example/"]
+The
+DID
+effectively adds a layer of indirection for the blog URL. This
+layer of indirection is under the control of the author instead of under the
+control of an external administrative authority such as the blog hosting
+company. This is how a
+DID
+can effectively function as an enhanced
+URN (Uniform Resource
+Name)
+—a persistent identifier for an information resource whose
+network location might change over time.
+B.9
+The relationship between DID controllers and DID subjects
+This section is non-normative.
+To avoid confusion, it is helpful to classify
+DID subject
+s into two disjoint sets based on their relationship to
+the
+DID controller
+.
+B.9.1
+Set #1: The DID subject
+is
+the DID controller
+This section is non-normative.
+The first case, shown in
+Figure
+7
+, is
+the common scenario where the
+DID subject
+is also the
+DID controller
+. This is the case when an individual or organization creates a
+DID
+to self-identify.
+Figure
+7
+The
+DID subject
+is the same entity as the
+DID controller
+. See
+also:
+narrative description
+.
+Two small black circles appear in the diagram, one on the upper left, labeled,
+"DID Controller", and one on the upper right, labeled "DID Subject". A solid red
+arrow extends from the DID Controller circle to the DID Subject circle, labeled
+"DID" in large bold text above the arrow, and "Identifies" in small italic text
+beneath the arrow. A dotted red double-ended arrow, labeled "Equivalence",
+extends between the two circles, forming an arc in the space between and above
+them. In the lower part of the diagram is a rectangle with bent corner, outlined
+in black, containing the label "DID Document". Arrows point between this DID
+Document rectangle and the small black circles for DID Controller and DID
+Subject, with italic labels, as follows. A blue arrow points from the DID
+Document to the DID Subject, labeled, "Describes". A green arrow points from the
+DID Controller to the DID Document, labeled "Controls". A green arrow points
+from the DID Document to the DID Controller, in an outward arc, labeled,
+"Controller". A dotted red arrow, labeled "Resolves to", extends from the DID
+controller starting to the right, branching off from the arrow to the DID
+Subject, then curving downward to point to the DID Document.
+From a graph model perspective, even though the nodes identified as the
+DID controller
+and
+DID subject
+in
+Figure
+7
+are distinct, there is a
+logical arc connecting them to express a semantic equivalence relationship.
+B.9.2
+Set #2: The DID subject is
+not
+the DID controller
+This section is non-normative.
+The second case is when the
+DID subject
+is a separate entity from the
+DID controller
+. This is the case when, for example, a parent creates
+and maintains control of a
+DID
+for a child; a corporation creates and
+maintains control of a
+DID
+for a subsidiary; or a manufacturer
+creates and maintains control of a
+DID
+for a product, an IoT device,
+or a digital file.
+From a graph model perspective, the only difference from Set 1 that there is
+no equivalence arc relationship between the
+DID subject
+and
+DID controller
+nodes.
+B.10
+Multiple DID controllers
+This section is non-normative.
+A
+DID document
+might have more than one
+DID controller
+. This can
+happen in one of two ways.
+B.10.1
+Independent Control
+This section is non-normative.
+In this case, each of the
+DID controllers
+might act on its own, i.e.,
+each one has full power to update the
+DID document
+independently. From
+a graph model perspective, in this configuration:
+Each additional
+DID controller
+is another distinct graph node
+(which might be identified by its own
+DID
+).
+The same arcs ("controls" and "controller") exist between each
+DID controller
+and the
+DID document
+.
+Figure
+8
+Multiple independent
+DID controllers
+that can each act independently. See
+also:
+Text
+Description
+Three black circles appear on the left, vertically, each labeled "DID
+Controller". From each of these circles, a pair of green arrows extends towards
+the center of the diagram, to a single rectangle, labeled "DID Document". The
+rectangle has the lower right corner cut and bent inward to form a small
+triangle, as if to represent a physical piece of paper with curled corner. Each
+pair of green arrows consists of one arrow pointing from the black circle to the
+rectangle, labeled "Controls", and one pointing in the opposite direction, from
+the rectangle to the black circle, labeled "Controller". From the right of the
+rectangle extends a blue arrow, labeled, "Describes", pointing to a black circle
+labeled, "DID Subject".
+B.10.2
+Group Control
+This section is non-normative.
+In the case of group control, the
+DID controllers
+are expected to act
+together in some fashion, such as when using a cryptographic algorithm that
+requires multiple digital signatures ("multi-sig") or a threshold number of
+digital signatures ("m-of-n"). These additional thresholds for
+verifying a proof can be expressed in a
+verification method
+as described in
+Section
+5.2
+Verification Methods
+or can be an intrinsic part of the
+verification material of the
+verification method
+, where the number of
+DID controllers
+that
+participated in the generation of a particular digital signature are hidden for
+privacy reasons. Verification methods that require a proof be produced by a combination of cryptographic operations performed by members of a group can be used to control the contents of a DID document; exactly how this is realized depends on individual DID method specifications.
+From a functional standpoint, this option is
+similar to a single
+DID controller
+because, although each of the
+DID controllers
+in the
+DID controller
+group has its own graph
+node, the actual control collapses into a single logical graph node
+representing the
+DID controller
+group as shown in
+Figure
+9
+.
+Figure
+9
+Multiple
+DID controllers
+who are expected to act together as a
+DID controller
+group. See also:
+narrative description
+.
+On the left are three black filled circles, labeled "DID Controller Group" by a
+brace on the left. From each of these three circles, a green arrow extends to
+the center right. These three arrows converge towards a single filled white
+circle. A pair of horizontal green arrows connects this white circle on its
+right to a rectangle shaped like a page with a curled corner, labeled "DID
+Document". The upper arrow points right, from the white circle to the
+rectangle, and is labeled "Controls". The lower arrow points left, from the
+rectangle to the white circle, and is labeled "Controller". From the right of
+the rectangle extends a blue arrow, labeled "Describes", pointing to a black
+circle, labeled "DID Subject".
+This configuration will often apply when the
+DID subject
+is an
+organization, corporation, government agency, community, or other group
+that is not controlled by a single individual.
+B.11
+Changing the DID subject
+This section is non-normative.
+A
+DID document
+has exactly one
+DID
+which refers to
+the
+DID subject
+. The
+DID
+is expressed as the value of the
+id
+property. This property value is immutable for
+the lifetime of the
+DID document
+.
+However, it is possible that the resource
+identified
+by the
+DID
+,
+the
+DID subject
+, may change over time. This is under the exclusive
+authority of the
+DID controller
+. For more details, see section
+8.11
+Persistence
+.
+B.12
+Changing the DID controller
+This section is non-normative.
+The
+DID controller
+for a
+DID document
+might change over time.
+However, depending on how it is implemented, a change in the
+DID controller
+might not be made apparent by changes to the
+DID document
+itself. For example, if the change is implemented through a shift in ownership
+of the underlying cryptographic keys or other controls used for one or more of
+the
+verification methods
+in the
+DID document
+, it might be
+indistinguishable from a standard key rotation.
+On the other hand, if the change is implemented by changing the value of the
+controller
+property, it will be transparent.
+If it is important to verify a change of
+DID controller
+, implementers are
+advised to
+authenticate
+the new
+DID controller
+against the
+verification methods
+in the revised
+DID document
+.

+The Working Group extends deep appreciation and heartfelt thanks to our Chairs
+Brent Zundel and Dan Burnett, as well as our
+W3C
+Staff Contact, Ivan Herman, for
+their tireless work in keeping the Working Group headed in a productive
+direction and navigating the deep and dangerous waters of the standards process.
+The Working Group gratefully acknowledges the work that led to the creation of
+this specification, and extends sincere appreciation to those individuals that
+worked on technologies and specifications that deeply influenced our work. In
+particular, this includes the work of Phil Zimmerman, Jon Callas, Lutz
+Donnerhacke, Hal Finney, David Shaw, and Rodney Thayer on
+Pretty Good Privacy
+(PGP)
+in the 1990s and 2000s.
+In the mid-2010s, preliminary implementations of what would become Decentralized
+Identifiers were
+built
+in collaboration with Jeremie Miller's Telehash project and the
+W3C
+Web Payments Community Group's work led by Dave Longley and Manu Sporny. Around
+a year later, the XDI.org Registry Working Group
+began exploring
+decentralized technologies for replacing its existing
+identifier registry. Some of the first
+written
+papers
+exploring the concept of Decentralized Identifiers can be traced back to the
+first several Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops convened by Christopher
+Allen. That work led to a key collaboration between Christopher Allen, Drummond
+Reed, Les Chasen, Manu Sporny, and Anil John. Anil saw promise in the technology
+and allocated the initial set of government funding to explore the space.
+Without the support of Anil John and his guidance through the years, it is
+unlikely that Decentralized Identifiers would be where they are today. Further
+refinement at the Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops led to the
+first
+implementers documentation
+, edited by Drummond Reed, Les Chasen, Christopher
+Allen, and Ryan Grant. Contributors included Manu Sporny, Dave Longley, Jason
+Law, Daniel Hardman, Markus Sabadello, Christian Lundkvist, and Jonathan
+Endersby. This initial work was then merged into the
+W3C
+Credentials Community
+Group, incubated further, and then transitioned to the
+W3C
+Decentralized
+Identifiers Working Group for global standardization.
